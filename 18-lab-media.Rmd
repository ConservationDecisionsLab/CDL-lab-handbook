# Lab Media Guidelines {-#}

## Terms of Use for Partnered Media and Photography {-#termsofuse}

The following terms of use apply to all images, media, and content shared with the Conservation
Decisions Lab, as agreed upon with the photographers or media partners. Each project partner
must review and approve the terms of use that best fit their needs before sharing any content.

The following options are based on [Creative Commons licensing](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), each has varying levels of
permissions and protections.

### General Guidelines for Lab &amp; Media Partners: A Checklist {-#generalguidelines}
#### ● Attribution: {-#attribution}
Always ensure proper credit is given to the photographer or media partner as specified
in the agreed-upon terms of use. The exact wording of the credit should be agreed upon
beforehand (e.g., photographer’s name, project name, or other relevant identifiers).
When publishing or distributing the media, ensure the attribution is clearly
legible—whether in print, online, or in presentations.

#### ● Respecting Licensing: {-#respectinglicensing}
The Lab should always include a copy of the agreed-upon license when sharing media
with external partners, collaborators, or media outlets to ensure the terms are respected.
This minimizes any confusion or misuse of the media and ensures that all parties are
aware of the legal boundaries for usage. For example, if an image is licensed for non-
commercial use only (i.e to promote research) that condition must be communicated
clearly to any third party.

#### ● Consent for Additional Use: {-#consentforadduse}
For any use of the media outside the scope of the original agreement (particularly
commercial uses, such as being sold to a third-party media outlet), explicit written
consent must be obtained from the photographer or media partner. This includes
reselling the work, licensing it for new purposes, or sharing it with organizations not
initially covered in the agreement. Always ensure that photographers are fully aware and
compensated (if applicable) for any commercial uses.

### Types of Licensing Agreements {-#typeslicensingagreements}
#### 1. Attribution (CC BY 4.0) {-#CCBY40}
This license allows for the broadest use of media, permitting others to distribute, remix, adapt,
and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given to the
original photographer.

- Terms:
  - You must credit the original photographer as specified by them.
  - You may not imply that the photographer endorses your use.
  - Media may be used for both Lab-related and non-Lab-related stories, provided
      the above conditions are met.

#### 2. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) {-#CCBYNC40}
This license permits others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work, but only for non-
commercial purposes. Any derivative works must also acknowledge the original photographer.

- Terms:
  - Media may only be used for non-commercial purposes (i.e., no resale or
    monetization).
  - You must credit the original photographer in any public or digital use.
  - Any alterations to the work must also provide credit to the original creator.
  - Media shared by the Lab may not be used in third-party commercial media
    outlets without additional consent.

#### 3. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) {-#CCBYNCND40}
This license allows others to download and share the work as-is, but they cannot make any
changes or use it commercially.

- Terms:
  - Media must remain unchanged and cannot be adapted or altered.
  - Use is restricted to non-commercial purposes only.
  - Proper attribution is required when the media is shared or published.
  - The Lab may distribute the media for educational or Lab-related content only.
    Any third-party use must receive explicit consent from the photographer.

#### 4. Custom Commercial Agreement {-#customagreement}
For media used in commercial outlets (such as major news organizations or publications), the
Lab may negotiate specific terms with the photographer that go beyond standard Creative
Commons licenses.

- Terms:
  - Any media shared for commercial use must receive the photographer’s written
  - consent and terms.
  - A fee may be required for commercial use or resale of the work.
  - Proper credit must be provided, and the terms of the commercial agreement
      should be adhered to strictly.

#### 5. Lab-Specific Use Only (Custom License) {-#customlicense}
In this scenario, the photographer grants the Lab the right to use their media exclusively for
internal and educational purposes or in Lab-related content. This is not a Creative Commons
license but a tailored agreement.

- Terms:
  - Media can only be used for Lab-related publications, presentations, and projects.
  - Media cannot be shared with external media outlets or used commercially.
  - The photographer retains full copyright and control over the distribution of their
    work beyond the Lab.

### Social Media {-#socialmedia}
When sharing images or media on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or similar outlets, it’s
important to acknowledge the unique challenges of crediting and maintaining control over the
distribution of content. Given the ease of reposting or resharing on these platforms, the following
guidelines can help ensure that proper credit is consistently maintained.

#### 1. Embedding Credits in the Image: {-#embeddingcredits}
One of the most effective ways to ensure credit is retained when content is reshared is
by embedding the photographer’s or creator’s name directly into the image or video. This
can be done subtly but visibly—such as in a corner of the photo or within the frame of a
video. The credit should be legible without distracting from the image itself.

* Example: A watermark in the bottom right corner that reads: “Photo by
  [Photographer’s Name]” or “[Photographer’s Handle].”

#### 2. Including Credits in Captions: {-#captioncredits}
When posting on Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms, always include the proper
credits in the caption. Tag the photographer or creator’s social media handle (if
applicable) and add a clear mention of their contribution.

* Example Caption: “Captured by the amazing @PhotographerHandle to highlight
  critical Marsh Biodiversity #PhotoCredit #ArtistName”

#### 3. Respecting Platform Limitations: {-#platformlimits}
Some social media platforms (like Instagram Stories) have shorter lifespans for posts,
making embedded or visible credits essential. Whenever you are posting temporary
media (e.g., Stories or Reels), ensure the photographer or creator is credited in the
overlay text or in any supplementary captioning that appears with the media.

#### 4. Permissions for Social Media Use: {-#socialmediapermissions}
If the photographer or creator has not explicitly agreed to social media distribution, make
sure you get their permission before posting. Social media may be considered a
separate usage category, especially if there is potential for commercial gain through
resharing or promotion.

#### 5. Responding to Reposts Without Credit: {-#respondingreposts}
In cases where an image or media piece is reshared without credit, kindly request that
the person or outlet that reshared the content either adds the proper attribution or takes
the post down if credit cannot be given.

* Example Message: “Thank you for sharing this image! Please make sure to
  credit the original photographer, [Photographer’s Name/Handle], as it’s part of
  our terms of use.”

By embedding credits directly into images or videos and consistently using clear captions, we
can better ensure that photographers and creators are credited properly, even as their work
circulates across various social media platforms.
