This student handbook has been designed as a guide to assist your transition into the UBC community and the community of the Conservation Decisions Lab. Within its contents you will find tips, tricks, and essential information for you as a student and as a lab member. If you find any information missing from the following pages or have any recommendations that could improve this guide please contact the CDLab manager, Abbie Sherwood who strives to make this an exhaustive resource. Please read this document in its entirety early on within your appointment to ensure that as a new lab member you are aware of the resources at your disposal and what is expected of each and every lab member. Dr. Tara Martin has committed to creating an active community within her lab space where she encourages the development of good collaborators and lab citizens. Within this space we commit to being intelligent, curious, motivated, compassionate, and hard-working. Thank you for joining us in our efforts to turn ecological data into decision making "],["diversity.html", "Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy Our JEDI Values Actions Best Practices in Research Resources", " Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy To begin we would like to introduce our justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) policy. The Conservation Decisions Lab and the Arcese Lab at the University of British Columbia—led by Dr. Tara Martin and Dr. Peter Arcese, respectively—have worked together to develop this Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Statement. We recognize the colonial contexts of conservation and academia, both past and present, and the systemic inequities that prevail. We see it as our responsibility to encourage, include, and make way for underrepresented and marginalized voices and perspectives; meaningfully collaborate with and support the work of Indigenous communities; and communicate our research to a broad cross-section of society across all demographics. We commit to decolonizing the work that we do, from the questions that we pose to the manner in which we undertake our research and communicate the outcomes. We commit to using our privilege to actively address any barriers or injustices witnessed in our work and daily life. We commit to working in a self-reflective and critical manner, and adapting and improving our actions to ensure our impacts align with the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Our labs are committed to recruiting and collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity is critical for transforming us into better students, teachers, scientists, conservation practitioners, and members of all communities. The challenges we face in conservation and as a society at large—whether they be related to biodiversity, climate change, and/or JEDI—require a shared understanding, novel perspectives, and transformative actions. We are actively working to reduce barriers to diverse representation in our research, in conservation, and in academia. Through this process, we aim to share knowledge, experience, and insight with each other that can be applied to our future workplaces, many of which share similar legacies of systemic inequality. We acknowledge that our labs—centered at UBC Vancouver—are located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.The land where UBC is situated has always been a place of learning where people for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next. Members of our lab engage in research on this land, as well as in the territories of other First Nations in BC and Indigenous communities across Canada. We have a duty to reflect on the nature of our work and reconcile it with the history and ongoing nature of colonialism, academic research, and Indigenous dispossession. It is our intent to foster meaningful relationships with the communities whose lands we are working on and engage in a research process that is beneficial to and is anchored by the values, goals, and interests of those communities and is conducted in the spirit of reciprocity. We acknowledge that each of us may be at different points throughout our journey in learning, listening, and cultivating an inclusive academic environment and that mistakes can be made. We also understand how important it is to learn from those mistakes and to not let fear of making a mistake be an excuse for inaction. To guide our journey, we are committed to continuously revisiting these values and updating this JEDI statement as a living document. We welcome feedback and inquiries concerning this statement. If you are a prospective student or collaborator and would like to know more about our lab policies, please reach out to our lab manager Abbie Sherwood (abbie.sherwood@ubc.ca) with any comments or to discuss any aspect of JEDI related to our labs. Our JEDI Values We value diversity of identities, knowledge systems, and worldviews in our lab and community. We value a lab culture whereby we can reflect on our personal and collective identities, both as researchers and as colleagues. This means we are actively acknowledging the intersecting privilege and/or barriers that we may or may not experience associated with our identities. We value acceptance. Discrimination—e.g., unjust treatment on the basis of sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, national origin, education level, physical and mental ability, age, physical appearance, or political views—in any form will not be tolerated within this space. Derogatory or hurtful comments are not acceptable, and all lab members are encouraged to initiate discussion when inappropriate behaviour or language is observed. We value accountability in supporting and nurturing a culture of safety within our team. All members of our team commit to creating a safe, supportive, respectful, and inviting community. We value an ongoing and iterative journey of learning. We recognize the continuous commitment to (un)learning needed to build a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive community. We commit to translating these values into action and carrying them out in our work and daily life. Actions Individual Actions Recognize and reflect on one’s own bias and privilege. Recognize privilege (e.g., status or experience) as a responsibility to provide space for underrepresented or overlooked contributors before ourselves. Devote time to continue learning about JEDI issues, working through provided JEDI materials, sourcing new materials, and contributing to the lab’s EDI materials library. Practice deep listening to ensure we are working with peers and collaborators in a meaningful way, rather than dictating or projecting our needs onto others. Welcome critiques of our words and actions, and remain open to engaging in uncomfortable conversations that are integral to change. Complete UBC’s conflict engagement course here. Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent the diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Include local knowledge holders, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research during study design, questions, analyses, and writing. Communicate and provide research outputs to those involved in and affected by the research and possible decisions influenced by this research. Commit to open science and data sharing when appropriate (e.g., with permission for any data that might be sensitive). Maintain epistemic humility and scrutinize methods, concepts, and questions using a multi-dimensional lens. Use inclusive pronouns and language. Be willing to share ideas, projects, and concepts with others. Recognize the Nations whose lands we conduct our research on, and include them meaningfully in all steps of our research process. Lab Community Actions Use this document as a social contract to foster a safe space within our lab community. Actively update this document to reflect new perspectives and growth annually during lab events. *Devote time to discussing JEDI materials, including JEDI-focused activities and group exercises, during lab events. Provide resources for members to attend JEDI courses, training, and workshops. Continuously build and update the online and physical JEDI learning library in the lab. *Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent a diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Facilitate discussion aimed to educate and encourage lab members on the best practices of including local knowledge holders, community groups, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research. Ensure that lab events are inclusive, accessible and safe for all lab members by providing multiple event options for venues and activities. Discuss one’s own and other’s research in the context of our JEDI values to ensure our research aligns with the values and best practices outlined in this document. Best Practices in Research We are committed to building our fluency and capacity in the following areas to facilitate best practices in JEDI in our research: Acknowledging power and vulnerabilities Follow best practices in JEDI in hiring and retainment, and encourage the department to follow suite Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in grad student/postdoc applications Provide basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Participate in basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Confronting harassment in the workplace Committing to transparency and accountability to the implications of our works E.g., Who benefits, who is impacted? Titleholder and stakeholder engagement throughout the research process Clarity around ownership and control of data Fairly acknowledging contributions Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in your work and research Committing to accessibility E.g., Communicating our research to diverse audiences Open access data (where appropriate), code, and publications Examining reward systems within and beyond academia (e.g., what constitutes “good” research questions, reward systems for research participants) Equitable hiring relative to opportunities (e.g., consider paid positions vs volunteers, make space early and often for conversations around additional resources and capacity for hiring graduate students and PDFs) Decolonizing our approach to research E.g., Fostering collaborative approaches to co-developing research, practicing accountability (e.g., “helicopter research”), and being open to timeframes and reward systems outside of academia Access training for appropriate ethics (e.g., UBC and Nation/community-specific intake processes), communication, and decolonizing “Doing our homework” - knowing where we work and the historical context of the systems we get to work in Be open and curious to multiple ways of knowing, learning, and communicating Daylighting health and wellness Prioritizing our own and each other’s mental health in grad school Openly discussing / holding space for health and wellness obstacles, personally and professionally (i.e., in academic spaces) Celebrating success beyond the h-index and the awards list! Resources As a part of our JEDI commitment we have established an online resources center for JEDI related materials. This is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. We encourage all lab members to add to this resource pool. Thank you in advance for contributing material that you believe will assist in our collective education. "],["commitments.html", "Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings 1-on-1 Meetings", " Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every two weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually via Zoom. Currently, Tara teaches each week durign the fall semester and is able to attend lab meetings in person, however may not be able to do so as regularly during the spring semester. It is strongly encouraged that all lab members attend face-to-face whenever possible as lab meetings offer a valuable opportunity to engage with other lab members and helps to foster a sense of community within the lab. However, we understand that circumstances differ amongst lab members and this may not always be possible. Lab meetings present a valuable opportunity for lab members to practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defenses and receive feedback from lab members. Additionally, students might use lab meetings to showcase their current work, or work that they have done in the past. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. Each lab member is expected to lead a lab meeting twice a year. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found here. This file also includes ideas for future meeting topics as well as a record of past lab meeting topics. The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined, the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab members by the CDLab manager who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting. As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our JEDI statement, these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for JEDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone else’s, but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so. Furthermore, we will review our JEDI statement and commitments as a lab on an annual basis to ensure that this statement adapts as we gain new lab members and as our collective knowledges &amp; understandings continue to develop. 1-on-1 Meetings Lab members will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. The CDLab manager will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester, according to each person’s availability, and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to the CDLab manager. "],["newvancouver.html", "New to Vancouver Cultural Awareness Events Statutory Holidays Housing", " New to Vancouver This is by no means an exhaustive list of tips and tricks for those who are new to the great city of Vancouver. Many of our lab members are from elsewhere in Canada and the world and so have gone through the process of moving and settling in Vancouver, and will be happy to give tips. We urge for you to communicate via our slack, via email or in person with other lab members who live in Vancouver and who will be able to provide more information and suggestions on how to enjoy the city to it’s fullest extent. Cultural Awareness As stated in our lab’s EDI statement Dr. Tara Martin encourages and supports lab members to take time to become aware of the culture surrounding Vancouver and the areas where research is conducted and beyond. It is expected that each lab member begins to familiarize themselves with the lush cultural surroundings of Vancouver and the Point Grey Campus. You will notice that a land acknowledgment is common practice during introductions. UBC provides a guide to assist those new to the land acknowledgment practice and we encourage all lab members to participate in this brief yet vital ‘Respect, Sincerity &amp; Responsibility: Land Acknowledgements @ UBC’ course. Enroll here. For those incoming lab members that are new to Canada and Canadians alike, we highly recommend and encourage enrolling in the ‘Indigenous Canada’ course offered by the University of Alberta and hosted by coursera which provides effective context to Canada’s history of colonization. This is a great course and is expected to take 21 hours to complete. We also greatly encourage new lab members to familiarize themselves with the First Nations House of Learning at UBC which is an incredible resource and provides opportunity to learn about how you can actively work to decolonize your own world view. Events There are many festivals and events throughout the year in Vancouver. Some that are recommended by lab members are: * Cherry Blossom Festival (April) * Celebration of Light (July) * Vancouver Folk Music Festival (July) * Pride (BC Day weekend, August) * Vancouver International Film Festival (September) * Fringe Festival (September) * Westward Music festival (September) * Vancouver Christmas Market (November-December) Statutory Holidays Statutory holidays recognized as paid holidays by UBC can be found listed here. Housing There are 14 on-campus residences at UBC Vancouver. Visit https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/ to find out more. If you are planning a move to Vancouver some of the most effective resources are Facebook, Craigslist, and Used Vancouver. Some have also had success by walking the neighborhoods they are interested in looking for vacancy signs out the front of buildings. There are many Facebook groups that advertise rentals, sublets and housemates, including Vancouver Rentals and Roommates, For Rent Vancouver, Vancouver apartments/houses for rent/roommates, Vancouver Buy/Sell Fast and Aussies in Vancouver. We encourage the use of our Slack where new members may ask housing related questions of those how have also gone through the process of finding housing in Vancouver. It is worth knowing that in BC, lease periods begin on the 1st of the month and sometimes on the 15th. The term of lease agreement varies from month to month, three months, 6 months, and a year. For those who are new to renting the Housing and tenancy page of the BC government website provides great resources on how to ensure that you legally protect yourselves as a tenant. It is highly recommended to ensure that your landlord provides you with a lease agreement regardless of history or personal connections.

This document outlines the policies and procedures for Forestry graduate students. Here is a link to the graduate student portal where you will find links to graduate studies advising and links to financial support opportunities among many other resources. Foresty Building Location You can use the UBC wayfinder to locate rooms and buildings on campus. Mailing address: Forestry and Conservation Sciences (FCS) 3041-2424 Main Mall Vancouver B.C. V6T 1Z4 Building Access Access to individual offices requires a key, which will be requested by FCS reception and issued by the Access Desk at the Bookstore, with a $20 security deposit (this information is from the 2020 academic year). Most students will not be provided with an office but will use the lab space as work stations. Since 2020, the FCS building has undergone a change of key system. As September 2021 approaches all lab members will receive an updated email from the FCS reception desk and the CDLab manager regarding new access processes which will utilize student/employee key cards. For card configuration issues see Andrea Chan. For after hours access issues call Campus Security 604 822 2222. Lab Room Our lab room 3202 and includes the kitchen facilities, lounge, desks and conference table. Please be considerate of anyone using the desks in the lab room. The main meeting rooms used by the lab are rooms 3003 and 3101 (known as ‘The Fishbowl’). Room 3003 includes a TV and webcam that can be connected to a laptop via HDMI. Room 3101 has wall space for a projector, which can be borrowed from FCS Reception (try to book in advance). These rooms must be booked in advance through Natasha Thompson at the FCS reception, and a key obtained from her at time of use. Common Spaces The kitchen on level 3 is room 3039. This is available to all staff, students and faculty, but is closed at 4:30 each day. There is a kitchen and dining area on level 4 (room 4003) that is for staff and faculty use only, unless it is booked for an event. Desks and lounge areas include the level 3 landing, and the Treehouse, which is the study space in the atrium with all the plants. Printing/Copying Room 3005 is the copy room for FCS. The photocopy code assigned to Tara and the lab is 426520, which is charged to Tara’s start-up fund. UBC Social Events 0.0.1 Seminars There are regular seminars held during the school year by the Department and open to staff, students and faculty. These include the Comparative Physiology seminar series and the FCS Wednesday seminar series. Notification of the FCS seminar is emailed to all staff, faculty and grad students. To be notified of other seminars and discussions, join email lists (see section 2.1.2). 0.0.2 Biodiversity Beers Biodiversity Beers is a social event held in the atrium of the Biodiversity Building every Friday at 5pm. All are welcome to attend, and also to volunteer for the buying/serving of drinks. Notifications for the event come through the zoology email list. Hazardous Waste Information about hazardous waste disposal at UBC can be found here. Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are: * Sharps (syringes, razors, blades) * Animal blood * Uncontaminated animal carcasses * Non-indigenous species (includes soil and plants) Disposal of biological waste may require special training. Contact Rolando Descalzo, Collections Manager, for waste disposal inquires (rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca). Sharps disposal containers can be purchased from the Chemistry Store on the corner of Main Mall and University Boulevard using a journal voucher. "],["transportation.html", "Getting to UBC Bus Car Bike From Vancouver Island", " Getting to UBC Bus Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby Skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. The information about U-Pass BC/Compass card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found here. UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC. A Compass card is the most cost-effective way of using Skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass cards can be purchased at vending machines in Skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7eleven outlets. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass card to give unlimited access to Skytrain, Canada Line and SeaBus services. A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include Skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo). Car Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased here. Designated parking stalls are available for car share services. Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative. Bike Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception. From Vancouver Island The 620 bus connects the transit system from Bridgeport station to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal (in both directions). It departs (from both directions) roughly around the hour, and depending on season/time of day it may have multiple busses that leave in 5-10 minute spacing around the hour. Often waiting for the second bus can be a great option if you want to have a seat/space to work on the go - but ensure there will be another bus or you will be waiting for an hour! From Bridgeport to UBC the most efficient routes are taking the skytrain either to Langara-49th station and then the 49 bus towards UBC, or taking the skytrain one stop further to Oakridge-41st and taking the R4 Rapid Bus towards UBC. These routes are also the best in the other direction. It is all ways a good idea to use Google Maps or Apple Maps to plan your route and see how long it will take you, and what route will be most efficient. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station.

The computer itself sits in the lab room 3202, but can be connected to from anywhere you have access to the UBC VPN. Please store any files that you need on the shared drive or the H drive rather than on the 3202a workstation/C drive as this system is reserved for running software that demands lots of memory and RAM. No one user should be taking up more than 10GB. Space usage is monitored. Scheduling time is done through the workstation-booking channel on Slack. You will be admitted to the CD Slack channel upon request by the lab manager. When using the remote workstation please be sure to monitor the slack channel as some lab members leave software running over night. Remote Desktop Connection Connect to the UBC VPN guide on how to connect found here). The application ‘Remote Desktop Connection’ will connect you to the workstation. Access this by searching it in the Start Menu. Enter the link frst-fcs-3202a.ead.ubc.ca and your UBC credentials (ensure the domain is EAD). Once you have logged in for the first time you can create a shortcut to bypass the above steps. With the Remote Desktop Connection window open, click ‘show options’ and then save as to add the shortcut to your desktop or another location. 0.0.2.1 Useful settings Settings are available in the Remote Desktop Connection window under ‘show options’. By default, when you connect to the workstation it will open up on only one of your screens (assuming you have multiple screens). To expand the workstation across your whole computer, tick ‘use all my monitors’ under the display tab. If the connection bar at the top of the screen gets in your way, you can hide it by unticking the box at the bottom of the display tab. To bring the connection bar back temporarily, use ctrl+alt+home. You can also move and shorten the connection bar. To link your local drives and folders to the workstation, go to the local resources tab, then ‘more’, and tick ‘drives’. This will mean that all your folders from your regular computer will be available through the workstation (note that this step will not work on UBC-owned computers due to the way they are configured). To link the lab shared drive, map the drive as you did originally (see lab handbook for instructions). If you are doing a task that requires a lot of power and is causing things to lag, you can reduce the colour depth under the display tab to improve performance. 0.0.2.2 Other things to know Only one person can be logged onto the workstation and using applications at any one time. However, multiple people can also have things running in the background whilst being disconnected, and this can happen while someone else is logged in. For example, two lab members can have code running in R on the workstation while another lab member is logged in and using ArcGIS. Note that anything running in the background may slow down work that someone is doing whilst logged in, and vice versa. To access the task manager (for example, if an application is not responding and you need to end the task), use ctrl+alt+end. Note that ctrl+alt+del will bring up the task manager for your local computer. The default settings keep the clipboard activated, so you can copy and paste between the local computer and the workstation. 0.0.2.3 Logging out/disconnecting DO NOT CLICK SHUT DOWN when using the workstation. Clicking shut down instead of disconnecting or logging out of the computer will turn the device off completely, meaning someone will have to go into the lab and physically turn it back on. This will not be damaging in any way, just an inconvenience, unless another user is running something in the background, then their work will be lost. Disconnecting from the workstation will take you back to your local computer, but the workstation will stay open in the background and whatever tasks you had running will continue. To disconnect, click the cross on the right of the connection bar at the top of the screen. Logging off is the same as for your local computer, i.e. unsaved work will be lost. Log off by clicking on your name under the Start Menu. Please log off whenever you have finished using the workstation. Shared Network Drive The shared network drive for the lab is called T Martin lab network drive, and is stored on the UBC server. It is available to lab members that have a UBC email address and CWL, and can be accessed off-campus via the VPN. Access to this shared drive is managed by Norm Hodges who will require your CWL to ensure your access to the workspace. This drive is capped at 20GB. The shared drive is used for storing files in a central, secure location. It is a useful way to back up files to the UBC server, and to allow large files to be shared with others in the lab instead of emailing them. You can encrypt files on the drive to maintain data security. How to access this shared drive - Instructions on how to map the network drive can be found here. In step 2 of the instructions, login with the domain ‘ead’ and your CWL ID eg. ead. You may need to be on ubcsecure wifi network rather than eduroam to connect to the drive. You can also connect from off campus if you’re on the UBC VPN. If you are having trouble connecting, contact the CDLab manager to ensure that you were given access. If this does not solve the issues contact Norm Hodges to help trouble shoot. Dropbox Shared dropbox folders are used within the CDL to share related files for certain projects. Upon your entry into the lab you will receive an invitation to the CDLab shared folder where you will find an assortment of helpful resources and information regarding the lab including equipment inventory, EDI statement and resources, ect. Slack Slack is a tool used for team communication. It is used for conversation that would otherwise clog our inboxes, such as quick project-related questions, lab events (eg. after work drinks), other events of interest (seminars, presentations etc.) weekly updates and general chit-chat. Documents and calendar invites can be shared in message threads called ‘channels’, with the option to also send private one-on-one messages. Be aware that all lab members do not use Slack equally, so important communications should still be sent via email. Your admittance to the CDLab Slack channel will be granted upon request by either the CDLab manager or another lab member. You will be required to create a Slack account. The app can also be downloaded for free. Github For those who have not yet been introduced to GitHub it is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software. The CDLab has a GitHub repository that can be found here. "],["financial.html", "Financial Out of Pocket Reimbursements Small Scale Suppliers", " Financial Out of Pocket Reimbursements The two common types of reimbursements are travel and non-travel expenses. Copies of the reimbursement request forms can be obtained from Forest and Conservation Sciences Reception (rm 3041), and are also available in digital form for print on the shared drive and in the shared dropbox folder found here. To claim a reimbursement, you must have a copy of the original receipts and a speedchart (four-letter code) indicating which grant the claim will be charged to. You will need to send the completed forms and receipts to the CDLab manager who will review the information and will submit the reimbursement request to Christine Mutia. Each grant under Dr. Tara Martin’s name has a separate speed chart, please ensure that you have the correct speed chart information before submitting a request. Please note that when charging kilometers driven please include a google map of the route that you took to prove the Kms stated on the expense form. Small Scale Suppliers When hiring or working with external contractors during projects please ensure that you contact the CDLab manager early and before the contractor begins work. The process of setting up an external supplier or vendor can take up to 6 weeks. Please speak to the CDLab manager for more information. "],["labequipment.html", "Lab Equipment General Field Equipment Laptop Computers Lab Truck Research Vessel Projectors UBC Storage Locker Specimen Fridge and Freezer", " Lab Equipment General Field Equipment The CDLab field equipment inventory can be found here. This list is a work in progress and will be kept up to date as more items are purchased. If you require the use of any equipment please ensure that you alert the CDLab manager prior to your field work excursions to ensure that the equipment is up to date on repairs and servicing and is accessible to you (is the equipment on Salt Spring or in Vancouver). Dr. Tara Martin, depending on the equipment in question and its function is willing to discuss the purchase of more equipment that could contribute to the overall function of the lab as a whole. Please note that all lab equipment will be inspected before an after use and please use this equipment with care and as if it was your own. Thank you. Laptop Computers The CDLab has a number of laptops currently in circulation (see equipment inventory list), along with desktop monitors, wireless keyboards, mice, and HDMI cords. At the beginning of your appointment please alert the CDLab manager of your computer needs if not prompted. Funding can be made available to purchase additional hardware space, RAM, and higher functioning devices if need be. A list of the devices that are most commonly ordered through UBC can be found here. When a device is being readied to go to a new student you will be asked to provide a list of software that you would like installed. Norm Hodges will pre-load all of the software that he is able to install before you receive this device. While you are in possession of a CDLab/UBC owned and operated laptop you are expected to ensure proper care of the device by observing the following best practices. In general, if you’re prompted to update software, don’t ignore the prompts indefinitely. On the weekend after the second Tuesday of the month (otherwise known as Microsoft Patch Tuesday), do the following: Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Check for updates, allow the laptop to update and restart. If a laptop user doesn’t routinely connect to the UBC VPN, they should connect for an hour or so every couple weeks to ensure Windows and Office licenses are updated and to ensure malware protection is updated. Otherwise, just remember the laptop is a fairly expensive piece of equipment. It’s not a hammer or a crowbar Lab Truck The field truck is available for use by lab members for fieldwork. It is a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with lockable canopy. The designated parking stall in the parking lot below Forestry is #19, but the truck is often stored at Dr. Tara Martin’s lab space on Salt Spring Island and so arrangements to bring it to the mainland for work must be made in advance. There is a UBC fuel card that should be used to fill up the vehicle, and is kept in a plastic sleeve in the glovebox. The purchase will then be charged to the designated project fund upon reconciliation. When using the vehicle, please remember the following: * Fill with fuel at end of use (a use may be multiple days) * Use fuel card in glovebox to fill up and keep receipts Fill out logbook in glovebox at end of use. Research Vessel The lab’s research vessel is a 6.26m outboard Silverstream with a 150 horsepower (HP) Yamaha engine and a 9.9 HP kicker engine dubbed ‘Sea Blush’. The vessel is moored on Salt Spring Island at a private marina in the Fulford Harbor. The vessel will only be operated by qualified operators, Dr. Tara Martin or CDLab manager Abbie Sherwood. When budgeting the use of the research vessel for a project use the ratio of 1 nautical mile to 1$ of gas and maintenance. Marine engines should only be filled with mid-grade gasoline. Please take this information into consideration when budgeting for vessel use during project planning. Projectors The CDLab owns two projectors: a portable one and a ceiling-mounted system in the lab room. The portable projector can be used for meetings and gatherings as needed. The ceiling-mounted projector includes an electronic screen, and both are controlled from the panel to the right of the whiteboard. Contact UBC AV services for any issues with the lab projector set up. UBC Storage Locker The storage lockers are located in the basement in room 0711. The CDLab shares storage space with Dr. Lori Daniels and Dr. Peter Arcese. In the Martin-Daniels locker there are boxes of supplies for hosting workshops. In the Arcese locker is field gear. Ask the CDLab manager for access to this space. Specimen Fridge and Freezer There is a specimen fridge and freezer in the lab room that are available for storing biological samples. The fridge for storing food is under the bench in the kitchen area. Please keep food and samples separate.

When your preparation begins be sure to visit the following field work safety pages. Field Work Safety | Safety &amp; Risk Services (ubc.ca) Conducting Off-campus Fieldwork | UBC Research + Innovation Travel and Field Safety l UBC A Field Work Safety Plan is required for all field work and must be submitted to your Department for approval before you head out into the field. This approval process can take a few weeks hence it is best to begin thinking about the preparation of this document well in advance. A safety plan template can be found here in the CDLab shared dropbox folder Safety Plans. Before submitting your plan for approval be sure to glace at the ‘Field Work Safety Plan – Completion checklist’. You can find this checklist in the same dropbox folder as stated above. Once Dr. Tara Martin has signed off on your safety plan you are ready to submit your safety plan for approval. Alter the CDLab manager when your plan is ready and they will indicate to whom you must send your safety form.

Download GitHub Desktop I use the desktop version of GitHub. I find it is the most intuitive way to work with the program and the website. There is an installation tutorial here. 2. Clone the Handbook Repository The first time you download a repository from a remote location you are creating a clone (Figure 1). This is the local version of the repository that lives on your computer. It is analogous to adding a shared folder in Dropbox. Figure 1: Cloning the repository to the local device. You will need to be part of the Conservation Decisions Lab Organization to see the available repositories. When you click on the ‘ConservationDecisionsLab/CDL-lab-handbook’ repository it will allow you to select where you would like to save the files locally (Figure 2). This is where you will be working with contents of the Handbook. Figure 2: Selecting the handbook repository and a storage location for the files on your device. Here I am saving the repository in my Documents/Analysis folder. Once you’ve cloned repository you are ready to start editing the files! 3. Workflow for Editing the Handbook 3.1 Pull the latest version of repository This should always be your first step when you are beginning to work on a new edit for the manual. This step essentially downloads any changes that may have been made by others. You can think of it like manually asking Dropbox for the latest version of a document that was edited by a collaborator, but rather than one specific document, GitHub tracks changes across the entire repository. In GitHub Desktop you can sync your files by clicking on Fetch origin (Figure 3). Figure 3: Fetch origin should always be the place to start to make sure you are working with the latest version of the handbook. 3.2 Edit the Files Editing the manual requires some basic understanding of R Studio, Markdown, and Bookdown. These tools allow us to build the web document. The file structure and names are important for functionality of the book. The key elements are highlighted and explained in Figure 4. Each Chapter is its own Markdown (.rmd) file, its number determines its place in the book. The index file acts as the welcome page and defines the formatting of the book. Larger edits to the structure of the book can be done through a re-numbering of the contributing files. Edits to the content of the Chapters themselves can be done by opening the R Project File ‘CDL-lab-handbook’. This will launch RStudio where the individual chapters can be opened and edited. Figure 4: File structure for the lab handbook. R Studio and Markdown The content of the handbook is written in Markdown using RStudio (Figure 5). Markdown is a simple language for editing text. It provides simple conventions for defining headers, incorporating links, inline code, images and more. Markdown relies on a system of symbols to indicate the formatting, rather than applying the formatting and editing the content at the same time like in Word. The formatting is then complied into HTML for visualization at the end. For the purposes of the Lab Handbook we really only need to understand the basics like headers, lists, and images. A helpful guide for the basics of writing in Markdown can be found here. It can also be useful to look at how the existing chapters look in R and see how this translates to the version of the Handbook that is currently online. Figure 5: Editing the content of the Handbook within RStudio. Bookdown Bookdown is the R package that is used to compile all the chapters and format the webpage. When editing for the first time you will have to download this package you can do this through the ‘Packages Tab’ in RStudio or running the command ‘install.packages(“bookdown”)’ in the console (Figure 6). Figure 6: How to install the Bookdown package (only required the first time). With Bookdown installed the final step of adding the changes to the Lab Manual after saving the edits to the .rmd is to recompile the book. You can do this by clicking on ‘Build’ in the top right pane, and then clicking ‘Build Book’ (Figure 7). This takes the changes that have been applied to the Markdown files and generates new HTML files that can be viewed online. Once the book has been built it will open in a pop-up screen and you can check to make sure everything looks right. Figure 7: Building the book compiles the changes made to the individual .rmd files and generates html documents that can be visualized online. 3.3 Push Edits to the Main Branch After making edits and compiling the book, GitHub desktop should show which files have been changed and what those changes are. In Figure 8, you can see that the paragraph that was edited has been highlighted and duplicated in red and green. The red version shows the previous text and the green version shows what it has been changed to. You can see I’ve changed the wording from ‘critical’ to ‘essential’ and that is highlighted within those paragraphs. You will also notice that all the files in the ‘docs/’ folder have been updated. This is due to the Bookdown compilation creating a new version of each file. The actual edits made will only be reflected in the corresponding html document for Chapter 2. Figure 8: Example of changes recorded in GitHub Desktop. The final step before committing and pushing our changes to the remote repository is to write a short comment about the changes that were made (Figure 9). This will help keep track of what was changed and when. Figure 9: Example comment to contextualize the changes that have been made. After noting the changes I’ve made, I can commit the change to the repository by clicking ‘Commit to main’. With the change committed you can now ‘push’ that change to the Remote Repository by clicking ‘Push origin’ (Figure 10). Now others will be able to see the changes that have been made. Figure 10: Push the change to the remote repository. You can create multiple commits before pushing them all at once if you have multiple discrete editing tasks that you would like to accomplish. 4. Collaboration and Conflicts Just like Dropbox can produce conflicted copies when two people are editing the same document, conflicts can occur in Git. To be honest, I’ve never used GitHub collaboratively so I don’t have the best handle on how this works. As long as two people don’t make different edits to the same section of text, GitHub should be able to integrate edits made to different components of the book. There shouldn’t be to many problems with simultaneous editing as, but it will be a learning experience for all of us and we can add what we learn to this section. A Comparative example with Dropbox Below is a table that outlines the steps of collaborating on a document through GitHub and compares them to the functionality of Dropbox. Hopefully this example will help elucidate the general workflow of GitHub, and how the steps provide control over each step of making edits.
