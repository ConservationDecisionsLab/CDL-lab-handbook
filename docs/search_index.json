Thank you for joining us in our efforts to turn ecological data into decision making "],["diversity.html", "Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy Our Statement Our Values Our Commitment to Action Best Practices in Research Resources", " Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy The Conservation Decisions Lab and the Arcese Lab at the University of British Columbia—led by Dr. Tara Martin and Dr. Peter Arcese, respectively—have worked together to develop this Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) policy. Each year, we come together to review the policy and make changes in response to changing needs, social and cultural contexts, and understanding of JEDI principles and how they apply to our work and our daily lives. Throughout the year, lab members also engage in discussions and share information about available learning opportunities, such as articles, seminars, workshops, or resources, to deepen our understanding of these principles and how to embody them in our actions. Our Statement We recognize the colonial contexts of conservation and academia, both past and present, and the systemic inequities that prevail. We see it as our responsibility to encourage, include, and make way for underrepresented and marginalized voices and perspectives; meaningfully collaborate with and support the work of Indigenous communities; and communicate our research to a broad cross-section of society across all demographics. We commit to decolonizing the work that we do, from the questions that we pose to the manner in which we undertake our research and communicate the outcomes. We commit to using our privilege to actively address any barriers or injustices witnessed in our work and daily life. We commit to working in a self-reflective and critical manner, and adapting and improving our actions to ensure our impacts align with the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Our labs are committed to recruiting and collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity is critical for transforming us into better students, teachers, scientists, conservation practitioners, and members of all communities. The challenges we face in conservation and as a society at large—whether they be related to biodiversity, climate change, and/or JEDI—require a shared understanding, novel perspectives, and transformative actions. We are actively working to reduce barriers to diverse representation in our research, in conservation, and in academia. Through this process, we aim to share knowledge, experience, and insight with each other that can be applied to our future workplaces, many of which share similar legacies of systemic inequality. We acknowledge that our labs—centered at UBC Vancouver—are located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.The land where UBC is situated has always been a place of learning where people for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next. Members of our lab engage in research on this land, as well as in the territories of other First Nations in BC and Indigenous communities across Canada. We have a duty to reflect on the nature of our work and reconcile it with the history and ongoing nature of colonialism, academic research, and Indigenous dispossession. It is our intent to foster meaningful relationships with the communities whose lands we are working on and engage in a research process that is beneficial to and is anchored by the values, goals, and interests of those communities and is conducted in the spirit of reciprocity. We acknowledge that each of us may be at different points throughout our journey in learning, listening, and cultivating an inclusive academic environment and that mistakes can be made. We also understand how important it is to learn from those mistakes and to not let fear of making a mistake be an excuse for inaction. To guide our journey, we are committed to continuously revisiting these values and updating this JEDI statement as a living document. Our Values We value diversity of identities, knowledge systems, and worldviews in our lab and community. We value a lab culture whereby we can reflect on our personal and collective identities, both as researchers and as colleagues. This means we are actively acknowledging the intersecting privilege and/or barriers that we may or may not experience associated with our identities. We value acceptance. Discrimination—e.g., unjust treatment on the basis of sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, national origin, education level, physical and mental ability, age, physical appearance, or political views—in any form will not be tolerated within this space. Derogatory or hurtful comments are not acceptable, and all lab members are encouraged to initiate discussion when inappropriate behaviour or language is observed. We value accountability in supporting and nurturing a culture of safety within our team. All members of our team commit to creating a safe, supportive, respectful, and inviting community. We value an ongoing and iterative journey of learning. We recognize the continuous commitment to (un)learning needed to build a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive community. We commit to translating these values into action and carrying them out in our work and daily life. Our Commitment to Action Individual Actions Recognize and reflect on one’s own bias and privilege. Recognize privilege (e.g., status or experience) as a responsibility to provide space for underrepresented or overlooked contributors before ourselves. Devote time to continue learning about JEDI issues, working through provided JEDI materials, sourcing new materials, and contributing to the lab’s EDI materials library. Practice deep listening to ensure we are working with peers and collaborators in a meaningful way, rather than dictating or projecting our needs onto others. Welcome critiques of our words and actions, and remain open to engaging in uncomfortable conversations that are integral to change. Complete UBC’s conflict engagement course here. Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent the diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Include local knowledge holders, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research during study design, questions, analyses, and writing. Communicate and provide research outputs to those involved in and affected by the research and possible decisions influenced by this research. Commit to open science and data sharing when appropriate (e.g., with permission for any data that might be sensitive). Maintain epistemic humility and scrutinize methods, concepts, and questions using a multi-dimensional lens. Use inclusive pronouns and language. Be willing to share ideas, projects, and concepts with others. Recognize the Nations whose lands we conduct our research on, and include them meaningfully in all steps of our research process. Lab Community Actions Use this document as a social contract to foster a safe space within our lab community. Actively update this document to reflect new perspectives and growth annually during lab events. *Devote time to discussing JEDI materials, including JEDI-focused activities and group exercises, during lab events. Provide resources for members to attend JEDI courses, training, and workshops. Continuously build and update the online and physical JEDI learning library in the lab. *Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent a diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Facilitate discussion aimed to educate and encourage lab members on the best practices of including local knowledge holders, community groups, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research. Ensure that lab events are inclusive, accessible and safe for all lab members by providing multiple event options for venues and activities. Discuss one’s own and other’s research in the context of our JEDI values to ensure our research aligns with the values and best practices outlined in this document. Best Practices in Research We are committed to building our fluency and capacity in the following areas to facilitate best practices in JEDI in our research: Acknowledging power and vulnerabilities Follow best practices in JEDI in hiring and retainment, and encourage the department to follow suite Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in grad student/postdoc applications Provide basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Participate in basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Confronting harassment in the workplace Committing to transparency and accountability to the implications of our works E.g., Who benefits, who is impacted? Titleholder and stakeholder engagement throughout the research process Clarity around ownership and control of data Fairly acknowledging contributions Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in your work and research Committing to accessibility E.g., Communicating our research to diverse audiences Open access data (where appropriate), code, and publications Examining reward systems within and beyond academia (e.g., what constitutes “good” research questions, reward systems for research participants) Equitable hiring relative to opportunities (e.g., consider paid positions vs volunteers, make space early and often for conversations around additional resources and capacity for hiring graduate students and PDFs) Decolonizing our approach to research E.g., Fostering collaborative approaches to co-developing research, practicing accountability (e.g., “helicopter research”), and being open to timeframes and reward systems outside of academia Access training for appropriate ethics (e.g., UBC and Nation/community-specific intake processes), communication, and decolonizing “Doing our homework” - knowing where we work and the historical context of the systems we get to work in Be open and curious to multiple ways of knowing, learning, and communicating Daylighting health and wellness Prioritizing our own and each other’s mental health in grad school Openly discussing / holding space for health and wellness obstacles, personally and professionally (i.e., in academic spaces) Celebrating success beyond the h-index and the awards list! Resources As a part of our JEDI commitment we have established an online resources center for JEDI related materials. This is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. We encourage all lab members to add to this resource pool. Thank you in advance for contributing material that you believe will assist in our collective education. "],["commitments.html", "Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings 1-on-1 Meetings", " Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every two weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually via Zoom. Currently, Tara teaches each week durign the fall semester and is able to attend lab meetings in person, however may not be able to do so as regularly during the spring semester. It is strongly encouraged that all lab members attend face-to-face whenever possible as lab meetings offer a valuable opportunity to engage with other lab members and helps to foster a sense of community within the lab. However, we understand that circumstances differ amongst lab members and this may not always be possible. Lab meetings present a valuable opportunity for lab members to practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defenses and receive feedback from lab members. Additionally, students might use lab meetings to showcase their current work, or work that they have done in the past. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. Each lab member is expected to lead a lab meeting twice a year. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found here. This file also includes ideas for future meeting topics as well as a record of past lab meeting topics. The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined, the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab members by the CDLab manager who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting. As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our JEDI statement, these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for JEDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone else’s, but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so. Furthermore, we will review our JEDI statement and commitments as a lab on an annual basis to ensure that this statement adapts as we gain new lab members and as our collective knowledges &amp; understandings continue to develop. 1-on-1 Meetings Lab members will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. The CDLab manager will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester, according to each person’s availability, and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to the CDLab manager. "],["newvancouver.html", "New to BC Cultural Awareness Housing Financial Driving Provincial Services Events Statutory Holidays", " New to BC This is by no means an exhaustive list of tips and tricks for those who are new to the great city of Vancouver. Many of our lab members are from elsewhere in Canada and the world and so have gone through the process of moving and settling in Vancouver, and will be happy to give tips. We urge for you to communicate via our slack, via email or in person with other lab members who live in Vancouver and who will be able to provide more information and suggestions on how to enjoy the city to it’s fullest extent. If you are moving to BC from outside of Canada, you may need to obtain a student or work visa prior to arrival. It is best to apply as soon as you have been accepted to allow for lengthy processing times. See the Canadian Immigration and Citizenship website for information about visa applications and renewals, working while studying, and staying in Canada post-graduation. Information and other helpful resources on moving to and settling in BC are available from the BC Government website, for those moving from outside Canada and from another province within Canada. Some information about relocating to BC are also available from the UBC HR website. Cultural Awareness As stated in our lab’s EDI statement Dr. Tara Martin encourages and supports lab members to take time to become aware of the culture surrounding Vancouver and the areas where research is conducted and beyond. It is expected that each lab member begins to familiarize themselves with the lush cultural surroundings of Vancouver and the Point Grey Campus. You will notice that a land acknowledgment is common practice during introductions. UBC provides a guide to assist those new to the land acknowledgment practice and we encourage all lab members to participate in this brief yet vital ‘Respect, Sincerity &amp; Responsibility: Land Acknowledgements @ UBC’ course. Enroll here. For those incoming lab members that are new to Canada and Canadians alike, we highly recommend and encourage enrolling in the ‘Indigenous Canada’ course offered by the University of Alberta and hosted by coursera which provides effective context to Canada’s history of colonization. This is a great course and is expected to take 21 hours to complete. We also greatly encourage new lab members to familiarize themselves with the First Nations House of Learning at UBC which is an incredible resource and provides opportunity to learn about how you can actively work to decolonize your own world view. Housing It is worth knowing that in BC, lease periods begin on the 1st of the month and sometimes on the 15th. The term of lease agreement varies from month to month, three months, 6 months, and a year. Note that many landlords will ask for references and/or proof of income as part of the rental application. For those who are new to renting the Housing and tenancy page of the BC government website provides great resources on how to ensure that you legally protect yourselves as a tenant. It is highly recommended to ensure that your landlord provides you with a lease agreement regardless of history or personal connections. Feel free to use the Slack group to ask other lab members about the process of housing in Vancouver. Here are some resources for finding housing in Vancouver: - For information about on-campus residences at UBC Vancouver, see https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/ - Other resources include Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Used Vancouver - There are also Facebook groups that advertise rentals, sublets and housemates, including Vancouver Rentals and Roommates, For Rent Vancouver, Vancouver apartments/houses for rent/roommates, Vancouver Buy/Sell Fast and Aussies in Vancouver - Some have also had success by walking the neighborhoods they are interested in looking for vacancy signs out the front of buildings Financial For opening bank accounts in BC when you move here, here are some helpful tips. Make sure you bring sufficient ID if opening in person! There are many options including Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, TD Bank, RBC, Vancity, and more. For information on filing taxes in BC &amp; Canada, check out the UBC Tax Filing information page as well as the BC CRA information pages. Important steps and considerations include: - Apply for Social Insurance Number (SIN), in which you must have a work permit or a study permit which includes a condition to work on and/or off campus. If you are not eligible for a SIN, apply for an Individual Tax Number (ITN), necessary for student scholarship. - Likely tax documents for students in Canada/BC are T2202, T4, T4A, which you can download from Workday. - The Canadian tax system is based on your residency status, not citizenship. You can file online, by paper, by mail, or with accounts, with more information on if you need to file and how to file here. - For support you can access the UBC Tax Assistance Clinic (UBC TACS), CRA Free tax clinics, or other resources. - Note: you may have to file taxes both in Canada and your country of citizenship. Depending on the country, there are some tax agreements in place to prevent double-taxation. This may require filing additional forms when filing taxes for one or both countries. Driving For Driving in BC, there are a couple of options, including the following to consider: - Upon arrival in BC, you have 90 days to switch your existing license over to a BC one, if needed. NOTE that full-time students may be exempt from this rule. Consult the ICBC website for more information about the process, including eligibility and required documentation. If you are moving from outside Canada, it is best to prepare the required documentation prior to your arrival. - Car registration and insurance is a fairly straightforward process with most information on the ICBC site about registration and insurance, but consider the following: - You have 30 days to register, license, and insure your vehicle after arriving in BC - Book an appointment (or show up) with your nearest autoplan broker (provide ICBC services) for registering and insuring your car. There is one in Westbrook Village that is very close to UBC. - Make sure you have proof of driving experience (abstract or license) already sent directly to ICBC for drivers license as well as bring additional identification. Note –it is significantly cheaper to have insurance in BC if you have a long driving record (sent to ICBC) and if you already get a BC license before registering your car and getting insurance. - Importing a car to BC is difficult and many steps but possible with perseverance. There is extensive information provided here about the steps and the forms needed. You will need to import it officially across the border and get it inspected before registration. - Note that if you are a U.S. citizen bringing your car to the province and are enrolled full-time at a recognized B.C educational institution, you won’t need to register your vehicle. Just apply for a non-resident exemption permit within 30 days of your arrival so that you can drive here. This permit allows you to continue using the registration, license and insurance coverage from your home state, for as long as you’re studying here. However, not many insurance companies are willing to insure cars in Canada, so you will need to hunt for one, although your car will be insured in Canada for up to 6 months of recreational travel if you are bringing short-term. If you have a valid driving license but do not own (nor wish to own) a vehicle, you may be able to sign up for car sharing services, such as Evo or Modo. Provincial Services Depending on your residency status, you may need to apply for a BC Services Card upon arrival to access provincial services, including health care. For information on health insurance in BC, check out the UBC Health Insurance page. Important steps include: - Apply for province’s medical plan (MSP), akaBC Medical Services Plan, upon arrival in BC - There is a three month waiting period for MSP coverage to start, so have private medical insurance if you are an international student (iMED). For Canadian students moving from outside BC, you should be covered by your former provincial health care plan during the waiting period. - For students, you will be automatically enrolled in AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, and at the start of the academic year as you are automatically charged the AMS/GSS Health and Dental fee - For postdocs/staff: depending on your appointment, you may be eligible for Extended Health and Dental Benefits. Enrollment will be done as part of your staff onboarding process. Events There are many festivals and events throughout the year in Vancouver. Some that are recommended by lab members are: * Cherry Blossom Festival (April) * Celebration of Light (July) * Vancouver Folk Music Festival (July) * Pride (BC Day weekend, August) * Vancouver International Film Festival (September) * Fringe Festival (September) * Westward Music festival (September) * Vancouver Christmas Market (November-December) Statutory Holidays Statutory holidays recognized as paid holidays by UBC can be found listed here. "],["newtoubc.html", "New to UBC Foresty Building Location Building Access Lab Room Meeting Rooms Common Spaces Printing/Copying UBC Online Access UBC Social Events Hazardous Waste", " New to UBC We recommend that all graduate students keep the GRADBOOK close at hand. This document outlines the policies and procedures for Forestry graduate students. Here is a link to the graduate student portal where you will find links to graduate studies advising and links to financial support opportunities among many other resources. Foresty Building Location You can use the UBC wayfinder to locate rooms and buildings on campus. Mailing address: Forestry and Conservation Sciences (FCS) 3041-2424 Main Mall Vancouver B.C. V6T 1Z4 This will go to the FCS reception, so you should talk to Natasha Thompson prior to shipping anything to that address (especially large or expensive items). Building Access Access to individual offices requires a key, which will be requested by FCS reception (see Natasha Thompson) and issued by the Access Desk at the Bookstore, with a $20 security deposit. Students should be provided with an office and should talk to Natasha Thompson for office related inquiries. For access to the building (after hours) as well as the lab room (all hours) and other key-card access rooms, you will need a physical UBC student or staff card. Once you have obtained a physical UBC card, see Natasha Thompson to have it programmed to access the lab room and other rooms you should have access to. For after hours access issues call Campus Security 604 822 2222. Lab Room Our lab room IS 3202 and includes the kitchen facilities, lounge, desks and conference table. Please be considerate of anyone using the desks in the lab room, but feel free to use the room. See above section for access to the lab room - however most of the time a lab member will be in the lab room and you can always knock if you don’t have your UBC card yet! Meeting Rooms Meeting rooms and TA pods can be booked through your UBC Outlook Calendar (web mail or outlook on PC/Mac, will not work on your phone). A list of rooms that are allowed to be booked self-serve is sent out monthly to your UBC email and includes the tech equipment for each room, currently (2024-10-29) this includes: 2101 Meeting room, 8 people 3003 Meeting room, 10 people 3101 Meeting room, 8 people 4001 Meeting room, 18 people 4101 Meeting room, 8 people 2500A/B/C TA Pods In your Outlook calendar you simply fill out the “Location” field (search using “Forestry” as the keyword and then check if room is available). To ensure your booking is accepted, it is recommended that you: to include a brief descriptor for their meeting (i.e. MSc/PhD committee meeting, research lab meeting, etc.) to include their department name and/or supervisor’s name to include their department admin in the CC/Optional Recipient field to assist with granting access to the meeting space (esp. for FSC 4001) Common Spaces The kitchen on level 3 is room 3039. This is available to all staff, students and faculty, but is closed at 4:30 each day. There is a kitchen and dining area on level 4 (room 4003) that is for staff and faculty use only, unless it is booked for an event. Desks and lounge areas include the level 3 landing, and the Treehouse, which is the study space in the atrium with all the plants. Printing/Copying Room 3005 is the copy room for FCS. The printing code assigned to Tara and the lab is 426520, which is charged to Tara’s start-up fund. You may use this code when you need to print something as long as it is a reasonable amount of printing, for very large printing needs talk to Tara or Madeline first. Scanning is free. The easiest way to use the printer/scanner is to use a thumb drive plugged directly into the printer/scanner and using the print/scan to USB mode on the printer. It will print PDFs but not Word docs. For after hours use when the door is locked you can access the key to the printer room by using your key card to get into the lock-box located at the far end of the hallway from the lab room. UBC Online Access Once you have received your student number and your first-time sign in information visit The University of British Columbia to establish your UBC Campus Wide Login (CWL). This CWL is your one place sign in for all of the UBC portals that will be at your disposal. The CDLab manager will send IT (Norm Hodges) and email requesting that you obtain access to the Forestry drives of UBC. They will Cc you in this email as your CWL will be required. The Forestry drives of UBC will give you access to secure data storage spaces and access to the shared lab Z drive. Here is a link to how you can map to this shared drive space. See Shared Digital Workspaces for more details. Be aware that some UBC software, like ArcGIS, only functions when using the UBC VPN – Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. Here is a guide as to how to set up your VPN for remote access away from the UBC campus. For more information on how to access the IT services of UBC (see section 2.1) UBC Social Events Seminars There are regular seminars held during the school year by the Department and open to staff, students and faculty. These include the FCS Wednesday seminar series (and social with coffee!), the IRES (Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability) seminar series. Both of these are emailed to all FCS Forestry staff, faculty and grad students. Lab members have also enjoyed some of the BRC (Biodiversity Research Center) seminar series. To be notified of other seminars and discussions, join email lists email list. Biodiversity Beers Biodiversity Beers is a social event held in the atrium of the Biodiversity Building every Friday at 5pm. All are welcome to attend, and also to volunteer for the buying/serving of drinks. Notifications for the event come through the zoology email list. Hazardous Waste Information about hazardous waste disposal at UBC can be found here. Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are: * Sharps (syringes, razors, blades) * Animal blood * Uncontaminated animal carcasses * Non-indigenous species (includes soil and plants) Disposal of biological waste may require special training. Contact Rolando Descalzo, Collections Manager, for waste disposal inquires (rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca). Sharps disposal containers can be purchased from the Chemistry Store on the corner of Main Mall and University Boulevard using a journal voucher. "],["transportation.html", "Getting to UBC Bus Car Bike From Vancouver Island", " Getting to UBC Bus Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby Skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. The information about U-Pass BC/Compass card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found here. UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC. A Compass card is the most cost-effective way of using Skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass cards can be purchased at vending machines in Skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7eleven outlets. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass card to give unlimited access to Skytrain, Canada Line and SeaBus services. A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include Skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo). Car Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased here. Designated parking stalls are available for car share services. Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative. Bike Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception. From Vancouver Island The 620 bus connects the transit system from Bridgeport station to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal (in both directions). It departs (from both directions) roughly around the hour, and depending on season/time of day it may have multiple busses that leave in 5-10 minute spacing around the hour. Often waiting for the second bus can be a great option if you want to have a seat/space to work on the go - but ensure there will be another bus or you will be waiting for an hour! From Bridgeport to UBC the most efficient routes are taking the skytrain either to Langara-49th station and then the 49 bus towards UBC, or taking the skytrain one stop further to Oakridge-41st and taking the R4 Rapid Bus towards UBC. These routes are also the best in the other direction. It is all ways a good idea to use Google Maps or Apple Maps to plan your route and see how long it will take you, and what route will be most efficient. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station.

CDL lab members and admin generally utilize either DropBox or the shared Forestry Z drive for digital storage and sharing although personal preference differs among members. Regardless of which storage option lab members utilize we all have access to OneDrive. "],["itservices.html", "IT Services 0.1 Software dowloads 0.2 Adobe products Lab Website Email lists", " IT Services IT services website will provide you with countless pieces of vital information about how UBC’s IT system functions. They are the central authority and set rules relating to IT and cyber-security. However, Norman Hodges (norman.hodges@ubc.ca) will likely be your most useful resource (especially if you are using a computer owned by the department). Norm is the IT Technician for our department (FCS) within Forestry and can support you when you first join the department in getting your software/laptop set up and if you require support in the future. Some of the main things that Norm may be able to help with include: Ordering computer hardware Installing software (eg. ArcGIS, R, Mendeley) Setting up a connection to the wifi and VPN Mapping the shared network drive Adding devices such as printers Required software updates that you don’t have permission to install Do note that if you are using a UBC owned and operated laptop you will be unable to install (some) software without Norm accessing your desktop remotely (or you taking it to him) and providing admin access to install software. Also note that UBC has strict rules (often under BC law) concerning some types of applications and software, and as such you can expect restricted access to some software. If Norm is unavailable, or you require other support you can reach out to UBC IT or Forestry IT (forestry.ithelp@ubc.ca) the Faculty wide IT service. It is worth noting, however, that Norm’s understanding of our lab-owned computers, the needs within our Faculty, and the specific software many of us use, means more often than not he is the most useful resource when it comes to IT. 0.1 Software dowloads To download software through UBC visit the UBC software downloads portal. You will also visit the same portal when re licensing software, but you will be prompted by email to do so. 0.2 Adobe products UBC is no longer going to cover costs for Adobe Acrobat Pro and Adobe Acrobat Creative Cloud. For those who need Adobe Acrobat Pro (offers you the ability to read and edit PDFs), Tara is happy to cover that annual cost. You will need to purchase an annual subscription (see instructions below) and then submit an out of pocket expense. Please email Madeline to get the correct code to charge this purchase to before proceeding. If you use and need Adobe Creative Cloud, please let Tara or I know and we’ll work with you to figure out how to pay for that. The annual cost for users will be: Adobe Acrobat Reader: Free Adobe Acrobat Pro: $25 USD (~$37.50 CAD) Adobe Creative Cloud: $85 USD (~$126.50 CAD) For Adobe downloads visit the UBC software downloads portal Lab Website The Martin Conservation Decisions lab website is www.taramartin.org The website is kept up to date regularly by Liljana.

The computer itself sits in the lab room 3202, but can be connected to from anywhere you have access to the UBC VPN. Please store any files that you need on the shared drive or the H drive rather than on the 3202a workstation/C drive as this system is reserved for running software that demands lots of memory and RAM. No one user should be taking up more than 10GB. Space usage is monitored. Scheduling time is done through the workstation-booking channel on Slack. You will be admitted to the CD Slack channel upon request by the lab manager. When using the remote workstation please be sure to monitor the slack channel as some lab members leave software running over night. Remote Desktop Connection Connect to the UBC VPN guide on how to connect found here). The application ‘Remote Desktop Connection’ will connect you to the workstation. Access this by searching it in the Start Menu. Enter the link frst-fcs-3202a.ead.ubc.ca and your UBC credentials (ensure the domain is EAD). Once you have logged in for the first time you can create a shortcut to bypass the above steps. With the Remote Desktop Connection window open, click ‘show options’ and then save as to add the shortcut to your desktop or another location. 0.2.0.1 Useful settings Settings are available in the Remote Desktop Connection window under ‘show options’. By default, when you connect to the workstation it will open up on only one of your screens (assuming you have multiple screens). To expand the workstation across your whole computer, tick ‘use all my monitors’ under the display tab. If the connection bar at the top of the screen gets in your way, you can hide it by unticking the box at the bottom of the display tab. To bring the connection bar back temporarily, use ctrl+alt+home. You can also move and shorten the connection bar. To link your local drives and folders to the workstation, go to the local resources tab, then ‘more’, and tick ‘drives’. This will mean that all your folders from your regular computer will be available through the workstation (note that this step will not work on UBC-owned computers due to the way they are configured). To link the lab shared drive, map the drive as you did originally (see lab handbook for instructions). If you are doing a task that requires a lot of power and is causing things to lag, you can reduce the colour depth under the display tab to improve performance. 0.2.0.2 Other things to know Only one person can be logged onto the workstation and using applications at any one time. However, multiple people can also have things running in the background whilst being disconnected, and this can happen while someone else is logged in. For example, two lab members can have code running in R on the workstation while another lab member is logged in and using ArcGIS. Note that anything running in the background may slow down work that someone is doing whilst logged in, and vice versa. To access the task manager (for example, if an application is not responding and you need to end the task), use ctrl+alt+end. Note that ctrl+alt+del will bring up the task manager for your local computer. The default settings keep the clipboard activated, so you can copy and paste between the local computer and the workstation. 0.2.0.3 Logging out/disconnecting DO NOT CLICK SHUT DOWN when using the workstation. Clicking shut down instead of disconnecting or logging out of the computer will turn the device off completely, meaning someone will have to go into the lab and physically turn it back on. This will not be damaging in any way, just an inconvenience, unless another user is running something in the background, then their work will be lost. Disconnecting from the workstation will take you back to your local computer, but the workstation will stay open in the background and whatever tasks you had running will continue. To disconnect, click the cross on the right of the connection bar at the top of the screen. Logging off is the same as for your local computer, i.e. unsaved work will be lost. Log off by clicking on your name under the Start Menu. Please log off whenever you have finished using the workstation. Shared Network Drive The shared network drive for the lab is called T Martin lab network drive, and is stored on the UBC server. It is available to lab members that have a UBC email address and CWL, and can be accessed off-campus via the VPN. Access to this shared drive is managed by Norm Hodges who will require your CWL to ensure your access to the workspace. This drive is capped at 20GB. The shared drive is used for storing files in a central, secure location. It is a useful way to back up files to the UBC server, and to allow large files to be shared with others in the lab instead of emailing them. You can encrypt files on the drive to maintain data security. How to access this shared drive - Instructions on how to map the network drive can be found here. In step 2 of the instructions, login with the domain ‘ead’ and your CWL ID eg. ead. You may need to be on ubcsecure wifi network rather than eduroam to connect to the drive. You can also connect from off campus if you’re on the UBC VPN. If you are having trouble connecting, contact the CDLab manager to ensure that you were given access. If this does not solve the issues contact Norm Hodges to help trouble shoot. Dropbox Shared dropbox folders are used within the CDL to share related files for certain projects. Upon your entry into the lab you will receive an invitation to the CDLab shared folder where you will find an assortment of helpful resources and information regarding the lab including equipment inventory, EDI statement and resources, ect. Slack Slack is a tool used for team communication. It is used for conversation that would otherwise clog our inboxes, such as quick project-related questions, lab events (eg. after work drinks), other events of interest (seminars, presentations etc.) weekly updates and general chit-chat. Documents and calendar invites can be shared in message threads called ‘channels’, with the option to also send private one-on-one messages. Be aware that all lab members do not use Slack equally, so important communications should still be sent via email. Your admittance to the CDLab Slack channel will be granted upon request by either the CDLab manager or another lab member. You will be required to create a Slack account. The app can also be downloaded for free. Github For those who have not yet been introduced to GitHub it is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software. The CDLab has a GitHub repository that can be found here.

This list is currently not up to date and if you are wondering about what equipment is avialble please reach out to Aidan for the time being until the list is updated. If you require the use of any equipment please ensure that you alert Aidan prior to your field work excursions to ensure that the equipment is up to date on repairs and servicing and is accessible to you (is the equipment on Salt Spring or in Vancouver). Dr. Tara Martin, depending on the equipment in question and its function is willing to discuss the purchase of more equipment that could contribute to the overall function of the lab as a whole. Please note that all lab equipment will be inspected before an after use and please use this equipment with care and as if it was your own. Thank you. Laptop Computers The CDLab has a number of laptops currently in circulation (see equipment inventory list), along with desktop monitors, wireless keyboards, mice, and HDMI cords. At the beginning of your appointment please alert the CDLab manager of your computer needs if not prompted. Funding can be made available to purchase additional hardware space, RAM, and higher functioning devices if need be. A list of the devices that are most commonly ordered through UBC can be found here. When a device is being readied to go to a new student you will be asked to provide a list of software that you would like installed. Norm Hodges will pre-load all of the software that he is able to install before you receive this device. While you are in possession of a CDLab/UBC owned and operated laptop you are expected to ensure proper care of the device by observing the following best practices. In general, if you’re prompted to update software, don’t ignore the prompts indefinitely. On the weekend after the second Tuesday of the month (otherwise known as Microsoft Patch Tuesday), do the following: Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Check for updates, allow the laptop to update and restart. If a laptop user doesn’t routinely connect to the UBC VPN, they should connect for an hour or so every couple weeks to ensure Windows and Office licenses are updated and to ensure malware protection is updated. Otherwise, just remember the laptop is a fairly expensive piece of equipment. It’s not a hammer or a crowbar Lab Truck The field truck is available for use by lab members for fieldwork (at a cost to cover gas/maintenance), please discuss with Tara if you think you may want to use it. It is a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with lockable canopy. The designated parking stall in the parking lot below Forestry is #19, but the truck is often stored at Dr. Tara Martin’s lab space on Salt Spring Island and so arrangements to bring it to the mainland for work must be made in advance. There is a UBC fuel card that should be used to fill up the vehicle, and is kept in a plastic sleeve in the glovebox. The purchase will then be charged to the designated project fund upon reconciliation. When using the vehicle, please remember the following: * Fill with fuel at end of use (a use may be multiple days) * Use fuel card in glovebox to fill up and keep receipts Fill out logbook in glovebox at end of use. Research Vessel The lab’s research vessel is a 6.26m outboard Silverstream with a 150 horsepower (HP) Yamaha engine and a 9.9 HP kicker engine dubbed ‘Sea Blush’. The vessel is moored on Salt Spring Island at a private marina in the Fulford Harbor. The vessel will only be operated by qualified operators, Dr. Tara Martin or CDLab manager Abbie Sherwood. When budgeting the use of the research vessel for a project use the ratio of 1 nautical mile to 1$ of gas and maintenance. Marine engines should only be filled with mid-grade gasoline. Please take this information into consideration when budgeting for vessel use during project planning. Projectors The CDLab owns two projectors: a portable one and a ceiling-mounted system in the lab room. The portable projector can be used for meetings and gatherings as needed. The ceiling-mounted projector includes an electronic screen, and both are controlled from the panel to the right of the whiteboard. Contact UBC AV services for any issues with the lab projector set up. UBC Storage Locker The lab has a storage locker in the basement of the forestry building. Ask Aidan for access to this space. Specimen Fridge and Freezer There is a specimen fridge and freezer in the lab room that are available for storing biological samples. The fridge for storing food is under the bench in the kitchen area. Please keep food and samples separate.

"],["howtocontribute.html", "How to Contribute to the Handbook", " How to Contribute to the Handbook 1. Download GitHub Desktop I use the desktop version of GitHub. I find it is the most intuitive way to work with the program and the website. There is an installation tutorial here. 2. Clone the Handbook Repository The first time you download a repository from a remote location you are creating a clone (Figure 1). This is the local version of the repository that lives on your computer. It is analogous to adding a shared folder in Dropbox. Figure 1: Cloning the repository to the local device. You will need to be part of the Conservation Decisions Lab Organization to see the available repositories. When you click on the ‘ConservationDecisionsLab/CDL-lab-handbook’ repository it will allow you to select where you would like to save the files locally (Figure 2). This is where you will be working with contents of the Handbook. Figure 2: Selecting the handbook repository and a storage location for the files on your device. Here I am saving the repository in my Documents/Analysis folder. Once you’ve cloned repository you are ready to start editing the files! 3. Workflow for Editing the Handbook 3.1 Pull the latest version of repository This should always be your first step when you are beginning to work on a new edit for the manual. This step essentially downloads any changes that may have been made by others. You can think of it like manually asking Dropbox for the latest version of a document that was edited by a collaborator, but rather than one specific document, GitHub tracks changes across the entire repository. In GitHub Desktop you can sync your files by clicking on Fetch origin (Figure 3). Figure 3: Fetch origin should always be the place to start to make sure you are working with the latest version of the handbook. 3.2 Edit the Files Editing the manual requires some basic understanding of R Studio, Markdown, and Bookdown. These tools allow us to build the web document. The file structure and names are important for functionality of the book. The key elements are highlighted and explained in Figure 4. Each Chapter is its own Markdown (.rmd) file, its number determines its place in the book. The index file acts as the welcome page and defines the formatting of the book. Larger edits to the structure of the book can be done through a re-numbering of the contributing files. Edits to the content of the Chapters themselves can be done by opening the R Project File ‘CDL-lab-handbook’. This will launch RStudio where the individual chapters can be opened and edited. Figure 4: File structure for the lab handbook. R Studio and Markdown The content of the handbook is written in Markdown using RStudio (Figure 5). Markdown is a simple language for editing text. It provides simple conventions for defining headers, incorporating links, inline code, images and more. Markdown relies on a system of symbols to indicate the formatting, rather than applying the formatting and editing the content at the same time like in Word. The formatting is then complied into HTML for visualization at the end. For the purposes of the Lab Handbook we really only need to understand the basics like headers, lists, and images. A helpful guide for the basics of writing in Markdown can be found here. It can also be useful to look at how the existing chapters look in R and see how this translates to the version of the Handbook that is currently online. Figure 5: Editing the content of the Handbook within RStudio. Bookdown Bookdown is the R package that is used to compile all the chapters and format the webpage. When editing for the first time you will have to download this package you can do this through the ‘Packages Tab’ in RStudio or running the command ‘install.packages(“bookdown”)’ in the console (Figure 6). Figure 6: How to install the Bookdown package (only required the first time). With Bookdown installed the final step of adding the changes to the Lab Manual after saving the edits to the .rmd is to recompile the book. You can do this by clicking on ‘Build’ in the top right pane, and then clicking ‘Build Book’ (Figure 7). This takes the changes that have been applied to the Markdown files and generates new HTML files that can be viewed online. Once the book has been built it will open in a pop-up screen and you can check to make sure everything looks right. Figure 7: Building the book compiles the changes made to the individual .rmd files and generates html documents that can be visualized online. 3.3 Push Edits to the Main Branch After making edits and compiling the book, GitHub desktop should show which files have been changed and what those changes are. In Figure 8, you can see that the paragraph that was edited has been highlighted and duplicated in red and green. The red version shows the previous text and the green version shows what it has been changed to. You can see I’ve changed the wording from ‘critical’ to ‘essential’ and that is highlighted within those paragraphs. You will also notice that all the files in the ‘docs/’ folder have been updated. This is due to the Bookdown compilation creating a new version of each file. The actual edits made will only be reflected in the corresponding html document for Chapter 2. Figure 8: Example of changes recorded in GitHub Desktop. The final step before committing and pushing our changes to the remote repository is to write a short comment about the changes that were made (Figure 9). This will help keep track of what was changed and when. Figure 9: Example comment to contextualize the changes that have been made. After noting the changes I’ve made, I can commit the change to the repository by clicking ‘Commit to main’. With the change committed you can now ‘push’ that change to the Remote Repository by clicking ‘Push origin’ (Figure 10). Now others will be able to see the changes that have been made. Figure 10: Push the change to the remote repository. You can create multiple commits before pushing them all at once if you have multiple discrete editing tasks that you would like to accomplish. 4. Collaboration and Conflicts Just like Dropbox can produce conflicted copies when two people are editing the same document, conflicts can occur in Git. To be honest, I’ve never used GitHub collaboratively so I don’t have the best handle on how this works. As long as two people don’t make different edits to the same section of text, GitHub should be able to integrate edits made to different components of the book. There shouldn’t be to many problems with simultaneous editing as, but it will be a learning experience for all of us and we can add what we learn to this section. A Comparative example with Dropbox Below is a table that outlines the steps of collaborating on a document through GitHub and compares them to the functionality of Dropbox. Hopefully this example will help elucidate the general workflow of GitHub, and how the steps provide control over each step of making edits. "],["lab-media-guidelines--.html", "1 Lab Media Guidelines {-#} Terms of Use for Partnered Media and Photography", " 1 Lab Media Guidelines {-#} Terms of Use for Partnered Media and Photography The following terms of use apply to all images, media, and content shared with the Conservation Decisions Lab, as agreed upon with the photographers or media partners. Each project partner must review and approve the terms of use that best fit their needs before sharing any content. The following options are based on Creative Commons licensing, each has varying levels of permissions and protections. General Guidelines for Lab &amp; Media Partners: A Checklist ● Attribution: Always ensure proper credit is given to the photographer or media partner as specified in the agreed-upon terms of use. The exact wording of the credit should be agreed upon beforehand (e.g., photographer’s name, project name, or other relevant identifiers). When publishing or distributing the media, ensure the attribution is clearly legible—whether in print, online, or in presentations. ● Respecting Licensing: The Lab should always include a copy of the agreed-upon license when sharing media with external partners, collaborators, or media outlets to ensure the terms are respected. This minimizes any confusion or misuse of the media and ensures that all parties are aware of the legal boundaries for usage. For example, if an image is licensed for non- commercial use only (i.e to promote research) that condition must be communicated clearly to any third party. ● Consent for Additional Use: For any use of the media outside the scope of the original agreement (particularly commercial uses, such as being sold to a third-party media outlet), explicit written consent must be obtained from the photographer or media partner. This includes reselling the work, licensing it for new purposes, or sharing it with organizations not initially covered in the agreement. Always ensure that photographers are fully aware and compensated (if applicable) for any commercial uses. Types of Licensing Agreements 1. Attribution (CC BY 4.0) This license allows for the broadest use of media, permitting others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given to the original photographer. Terms: You must credit the original photographer as specified by them. You may not imply that the photographer endorses your use. Media may be used for both Lab-related and non-Lab-related stories, provided the above conditions are met. 2. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) This license permits others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work, but only for non- commercial purposes. Any derivative works must also acknowledge the original photographer. Terms: Media may only be used for non-commercial purposes (i.e., no resale or monetization). You must credit the original photographer in any public or digital use. Any alterations to the work must also provide credit to the original creator. Media shared by the Lab may not be used in third-party commercial media outlets without additional consent. 3. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) This license allows others to download and share the work as-is, but they cannot make any changes or use it commercially. Terms: Media must remain unchanged and cannot be adapted or altered. Use is restricted to non-commercial purposes only. Proper attribution is required when the media is shared or published. The Lab may distribute the media for educational or Lab-related content only. Any third-party use must receive explicit consent from the photographer. 4. Custom Commercial Agreement For media used in commercial outlets (such as major news organizations or publications), the Lab may negotiate specific terms with the photographer that go beyond standard Creative Commons licenses. Terms: Any media shared for commercial use must receive the photographer’s written consent and terms. A fee may be required for commercial use or resale of the work. Proper credit must be provided, and the terms of the commercial agreement should be adhered to strictly. 5. Lab-Specific Use Only (Custom License) In this scenario, the photographer grants the Lab the right to use their media exclusively for internal and educational purposes or in Lab-related content. This is not a Creative Commons license but a tailored agreement. Terms: Media can only be used for Lab-related publications, presentations, and projects. Media cannot be shared with external media outlets or used commercially. The photographer retains full copyright and control over the distribution of their work beyond the Lab. Social Media When sharing images or media on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or similar outlets, it’s important to acknowledge the unique challenges of crediting and maintaining control over the distribution of content. Given the ease of reposting or resharing on these platforms, the following guidelines can help ensure that proper credit is consistently maintained. 1. Embedding Credits in the Image: One of the most effective ways to ensure credit is retained when content is reshared is by embedding the photographer’s or creator’s name directly into the image or video. This can be done subtly but visibly—such as in a corner of the photo or within the frame of a video. The credit should be legible without distracting from the image itself. Example: A watermark in the bottom right corner that reads: “Photo by [Photographer’s Name]” or “[Photographer’s Handle].” 2. Including Credits in Captions: When posting on Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms, always include the proper credits in the caption. Tag the photographer or creator’s social media handle (if applicable) and add a clear mention of their contribution. Example Caption: “Captured by the amazing @PhotographerHandle to highlight critical Marsh Biodiversity #PhotoCredit #ArtistName” 3. Respecting Platform Limitations: Some social media platforms (like Instagram Stories) have shorter lifespans for posts, making embedded or visible credits essential. Whenever you are posting temporary media (e.g., Stories or Reels), ensure the photographer or creator is credited in the overlay text or in any supplementary captioning that appears with the media. 4. Permissions for Social Media Use: If the photographer or creator has not explicitly agreed to social media distribution, make sure you get their permission before posting. Social media may be considered a separate usage category, especially if there is potential for commercial gain through resharing or promotion. 5. Responding to Reposts Without Credit: In cases where an image or media piece is reshared without credit, kindly request that the person or outlet that reshared the content either adds the proper attribution or takes the post down if credit cannot be given. Example Message: “Thank you for sharing this image! Please make sure to credit the original photographer, [Photographer’s Name/Handle], as it’s part of our terms of use.” By embedding credits directly into images or videos and consistently using clear captions, we can better ensure that photographers and creators are credited properly, even as their work circulates across various social media platforms.

Within this space we commit to being intelligent, curious, motivated, compassionate, and hard-working. Thank you for joining us in our efforts to turn ecological data into decision making "],["diversity.html", "Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy Our Statement Our Values Our Commitment to Action Best Practices in Research Resources", " Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy The Conservation Decisions Lab and the Arcese Lab at the University of British Columbia—led by Dr. Tara Martin and Dr. Peter Arcese, respectively—have worked together to develop this Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) policy. Each year, we come together to review the policy and make changes in response to changing needs, social and cultural contexts, and understanding of JEDI principles and how they apply to our work and our daily lives. Throughout the year, lab members also engage in discussions and share information about available learning opportunities, such as articles, seminars, workshops, or resources, to deepen our understanding of these principles and how to embody them in our actions. Our Statement We recognize the colonial contexts of conservation and academia, both past and present, and the systemic inequities that prevail. We see it as our responsibility to encourage, include, and make way for underrepresented and marginalized voices and perspectives; meaningfully collaborate with and support the work of Indigenous communities; and communicate our research to a broad cross-section of society across all demographics. We commit to decolonizing the work that we do, from the questions that we pose to the manner in which we undertake our research and communicate the outcomes. We commit to using our privilege to actively address any barriers or injustices witnessed in our work and daily life. We commit to working in a self-reflective and critical manner, and adapting and improving our actions to ensure our impacts align with the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Our labs are committed to recruiting and collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity is critical for transforming us into better students, teachers, scientists, conservation practitioners, and members of all communities. The challenges we face in conservation and as a society at large—whether they be related to biodiversity, climate change, and/or JEDI—require a shared understanding, novel perspectives, and transformative actions. We are actively working to reduce barriers to diverse representation in our research, in conservation, and in academia. Through this process, we aim to share knowledge, experience, and insight with each other that can be applied to our future workplaces, many of which share similar legacies of systemic inequality. We acknowledge that our labs—centered at UBC Vancouver—are located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.The land where UBC is situated has always been a place of learning where people for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next. Members of our lab engage in research on this land, as well as in the territories of other First Nations in BC and Indigenous communities across Canada. We have a duty to reflect on the nature of our work and reconcile it with the history and ongoing nature of colonialism, academic research, and Indigenous dispossession. It is our intent to foster meaningful relationships with the communities whose lands we are working on and engage in a research process that is beneficial to and is anchored by the values, goals, and interests of those communities and is conducted in the spirit of reciprocity. We acknowledge that each of us may be at different points throughout our journey in learning, listening, and cultivating an inclusive academic environment and that mistakes can be made. We also understand how important it is to learn from those mistakes and to not let fear of making a mistake be an excuse for inaction. To guide our journey, we are committed to continuously revisiting these values and updating this JEDI statement as a living document. Our Values We value diversity of identities, knowledge systems, and worldviews in our lab and community. We value a lab culture whereby we can reflect on our personal and collective identities, both as researchers and as colleagues. This means we are actively acknowledging the intersecting privilege and/or barriers that we may or may not experience associated with our identities. We value acceptance. Discrimination—e.g., unjust treatment on the basis of sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, national origin, education level, physical and mental ability, age, physical appearance, or political views—in any form will not be tolerated within this space. Derogatory or hurtful comments are not acceptable, and all lab members are encouraged to initiate discussion when inappropriate behaviour or language is observed. We value accountability in supporting and nurturing a culture of safety within our team. All members of our team commit to creating a safe, supportive, respectful, and inviting community. We value an ongoing and iterative journey of learning. We recognize the continuous commitment to (un)learning needed to build a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive community. We commit to translating these values into action and carrying them out in our work and daily life. Our Commitment to Action Individual Actions Recognize and reflect on one’s own bias and privilege. Recognize privilege (e.g., status or experience) as a responsibility to provide space for underrepresented or overlooked contributors before ourselves. Devote time to continue learning about JEDI issues, working through provided JEDI materials, sourcing new materials, and contributing to the lab’s EDI materials library. Practice deep listening to ensure we are working with peers and collaborators in a meaningful way, rather than dictating or projecting our needs onto others. Welcome critiques of our words and actions, and remain open to engaging in uncomfortable conversations that are integral to change. Complete UBC’s conflict engagement course here. Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent the diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Include local knowledge holders, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research during study design, questions, analyses, and writing. Communicate and provide research outputs to those involved in and affected by the research and possible decisions influenced by this research. Commit to open science and data sharing when appropriate (e.g., with permission for any data that might be sensitive). Maintain epistemic humility and scrutinize methods, concepts, and questions using a multi-dimensional lens. Use inclusive pronouns and language. Be willing to share ideas, projects, and concepts with others. Recognize the Nations whose lands we conduct our research on, and include them meaningfully in all steps of our research process. Lab Community Actions Use this document as a social contract to foster a safe space within our lab community. Actively update this document to reflect new perspectives and growth annually during lab events. *Devote time to discussing JEDI materials, including JEDI-focused activities and group exercises, during lab events. Provide resources for members to attend JEDI courses, training, and workshops. Continuously build and update the online and physical JEDI learning library in the lab. *Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent a diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Facilitate discussion aimed to educate and encourage lab members on the best practices of including local knowledge holders, community groups, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research. Ensure that lab events are inclusive, accessible and safe for all lab members by providing multiple event options for venues and activities. Discuss one’s own and other’s research in the context of our JEDI values to ensure our research aligns with the values and best practices outlined in this document. Best Practices in Research We are committed to building our fluency and capacity in the following areas to facilitate best practices in JEDI in our research: Acknowledging power and vulnerabilities Follow best practices in JEDI in hiring and retainment, and encourage the department to follow suite Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in grad student/postdoc applications Provide basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Participate in basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Confronting harassment in the workplace Committing to transparency and accountability to the implications of our works E.g., Who benefits, who is impacted? Titleholder and stakeholder engagement throughout the research process Clarity around ownership and control of data Fairly acknowledging contributions Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in your work and research Committing to accessibility E.g., Communicating our research to diverse audiences Open access data (where appropriate), code, and publications Examining reward systems within and beyond academia (e.g., what constitutes “good” research questions, reward systems for research participants) Equitable hiring relative to opportunities (e.g., consider paid positions vs volunteers, make space early and often for conversations around additional resources and capacity for hiring graduate students and PDFs) Decolonizing our approach to research E.g., Fostering collaborative approaches to co-developing research, practicing accountability (e.g., “helicopter research”), and being open to timeframes and reward systems outside of academia Access training for appropriate ethics (e.g., UBC and Nation/community-specific intake processes), communication, and decolonizing “Doing our homework” - knowing where we work and the historical context of the systems we get to work in Be open and curious to multiple ways of knowing, learning, and communicating Daylighting health and wellness Prioritizing our own and each other’s mental health in grad school Openly discussing / holding space for health and wellness obstacles, personally and professionally (i.e., in academic spaces) Celebrating success beyond the h-index and the awards list! Resources As a part of our JEDI commitment we have established an online resources center for JEDI related materials. This is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. We encourage all lab members to add to this resource pool. Thank you in advance for contributing material that you believe will assist in our collective education. "],["commitments.html", "Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings 1-on-1 Meetings", " Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every two weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually via Zoom. Currently, Tara teaches each week durign the fall semester and is able to attend lab meetings in person, however may not be able to do so as regularly during the spring semester. It is strongly encouraged that all lab members attend face-to-face whenever possible as lab meetings offer a valuable opportunity to engage with other lab members and helps to foster a sense of community within the lab. However, we understand that circumstances differ amongst lab members and this may not always be possible. Lab meetings present a valuable opportunity for lab members to practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defenses and receive feedback from lab members. Additionally, students might use lab meetings to showcase their current work, or work that they have done in the past. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. Each lab member is expected to lead a lab meeting twice a year. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found here. This file also includes ideas for future meeting topics as well as a record of past lab meeting topics. The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined, the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab members by the CDLab manager who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting. As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our JEDI statement, these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for JEDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone else’s, but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so. Furthermore, we will review our JEDI statement and commitments as a lab on an annual basis to ensure that this statement adapts as we gain new lab members and as our collective knowledges &amp; understandings continue to develop. 1-on-1 Meetings Lab members will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. The CDLab manager will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester, according to each person’s availability, and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to the CDLab manager. "],["newvancouver.html", "New to BC Cultural Awareness Housing Financial Driving Provincial Services Events Statutory Holidays", " New to BC This is by no means an exhaustive list of tips and tricks for those who are new to the great city of Vancouver. Many of our lab members are from elsewhere in Canada and the world and so have gone through the process of moving and settling in Vancouver, and will be happy to give tips. We urge for you to communicate via our slack, via email or in person with other lab members who live in Vancouver and who will be able to provide more information and suggestions on how to enjoy the city to it’s fullest extent. If you are moving to BC from outside of Canada, you may need to obtain a student or work visa prior to arrival. It is best to apply as soon as you have been accepted to allow for lengthy processing times. See the Canadian Immigration and Citizenship website for information about visa applications and renewals, working while studying, and staying in Canada post-graduation. Information and other helpful resources on moving to and settling in BC are available from the BC Government website, for those moving from outside Canada and from another province within Canada. Some information about relocating to BC are also available from the UBC HR website. Cultural Awareness As stated in our lab’s EDI statement Dr. Tara Martin encourages and supports lab members to take time to become aware of the culture surrounding Vancouver and the areas where research is conducted and beyond. It is expected that each lab member begins to familiarize themselves with the lush cultural surroundings of Vancouver and the Point Grey Campus. You will notice that a land acknowledgment is common practice during introductions. UBC provides a guide to assist those new to the land acknowledgment practice and we encourage all lab members to participate in this brief yet vital ‘Respect, Sincerity &amp; Responsibility: Land Acknowledgements @ UBC’ course. Enroll here. For those incoming lab members that are new to Canada and Canadians alike, we highly recommend and encourage enrolling in the ‘Indigenous Canada’ course offered by the University of Alberta and hosted by coursera which provides effective context to Canada’s history of colonization. This is a great course and is expected to take 21 hours to complete. We also greatly encourage new lab members to familiarize themselves with the First Nations House of Learning at UBC which is an incredible resource and provides opportunity to learn about how you can actively work to decolonize your own world view. Housing It is worth knowing that in BC, lease periods begin on the 1st of the month and sometimes on the 15th. The term of lease agreement varies from month to month, three months, 6 months, and a year. Note that many landlords will ask for references and/or proof of income as part of the rental application. For those who are new to renting the Housing and tenancy page of the BC government website provides great resources on how to ensure that you legally protect yourselves as a tenant. It is highly recommended to ensure that your landlord provides you with a lease agreement regardless of history or personal connections. Feel free to use the Slack group to ask other lab members about the process of housing in Vancouver. Here are some resources for finding housing in Vancouver: - For information about on-campus residences at UBC Vancouver, see https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/ - Other resources include Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Used Vancouver - There are also Facebook groups that advertise rentals, sublets and housemates, including Vancouver Rentals and Roommates, For Rent Vancouver, Vancouver apartments/houses for rent/roommates, Vancouver Buy/Sell Fast and Aussies in Vancouver - Some have also had success by walking the neighborhoods they are interested in looking for vacancy signs out the front of buildings Financial For opening bank accounts in BC when you move here, here are some helpful tips. Make sure you bring sufficient ID if opening in person! There are many options including Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, TD Bank, RBC, Vancity, and more. For information on filing taxes in BC &amp; Canada, check out the UBC Tax Filing information page as well as the BC CRA information pages. Important steps and considerations include: - Apply for Social Insurance Number (SIN), in which you must have a work permit or a study permit which includes a condition to work on and/or off campus. If you are not eligible for a SIN, apply for an Individual Tax Number (ITN), necessary for student scholarship. - Likely tax documents for students in Canada/BC are T2202, T4, T4A, which you can download from Workday. - The Canadian tax system is based on your residency status, not citizenship. You can file online, by paper, by mail, or with accounts, with more information on if you need to file and how to file here. - For support you can access the UBC Tax Assistance Clinic (UBC TACS), CRA Free tax clinics, or other resources. - Note: you may have to file taxes both in Canada and your country of citizenship. Depending on the country, there are some tax agreements in place to prevent double-taxation. This may require filing additional forms when filing taxes for one or both countries. Driving For Driving in BC, there are a couple of options, including the following to consider: - Upon arrival in BC, you have 90 days to switch your existing license over to a BC one, if needed. NOTE that full-time students may be exempt from this rule. Consult the ICBC website for more information about the process, including eligibility and required documentation. If you are moving from outside Canada, it is best to prepare the required documentation prior to your arrival. - Car registration and insurance is a fairly straightforward process with most information on the ICBC site about registration and insurance, but consider the following: - You have 30 days to register, license, and insure your vehicle after arriving in BC - Book an appointment (or show up) with your nearest autoplan broker (provide ICBC services) for registering and insuring your car. There is one in Westbrook Village that is very close to UBC. - Make sure you have proof of driving experience (abstract or license) already sent directly to ICBC for drivers license as well as bring additional identification. Note –it is significantly cheaper to have insurance in BC if you have a long driving record (sent to ICBC) and if you already get a BC license before registering your car and getting insurance. - Importing a car to BC is difficult and many steps but possible with perseverance. There is extensive information provided here about the steps and the forms needed. You will need to import it officially across the border and get it inspected before registration. - Note that if you are a U.S. citizen bringing your car to the province and are enrolled full-time at a recognized B.C educational institution, you won’t need to register your vehicle. Just apply for a non-resident exemption permit within 30 days of your arrival so that you can drive here. This permit allows you to continue using the registration, license and insurance coverage from your home state, for as long as you’re studying here. However, not many insurance companies are willing to insure cars in Canada, so you will need to hunt for one, although your car will be insured in Canada for up to 6 months of recreational travel if you are bringing short-term. If you have a valid driving license but do not own (nor wish to own) a vehicle, you may be able to sign up for car sharing services, such as Evo or Modo. Provincial Services Depending on your residency status, you may need to apply for a BC Services Card upon arrival to access provincial services, including health care. For information on health insurance in BC, check out the UBC Health Insurance page. Important steps include: - Apply for province’s medical plan (MSP), akaBC Medical Services Plan, upon arrival in BC - There is a three month waiting period for MSP coverage to start, so have private medical insurance if you are an international student (iMED). For Canadian students moving from outside BC, you should be covered by your former provincial health care plan during the waiting period. - For students, you will be automatically enrolled in AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, and at the start of the academic year as you are automatically charged the AMS/GSS Health and Dental fee - For postdocs/staff: depending on your appointment, you may be eligible for Extended Health and Dental Benefits. Enrollment will be done as part of your staff onboarding process. Events There are many festivals and events throughout the year in Vancouver. Some that are recommended by lab members are: * Cherry Blossom Festival (April) * Celebration of Light (July) * Vancouver Folk Music Festival (July) * Pride (BC Day weekend, August) * Vancouver International Film Festival (September) * Fringe Festival (September) * Westward Music festival (September) * Vancouver Christmas Market (November-December) Statutory Holidays Statutory holidays recognized as paid holidays by UBC can be found listed here.

This document outlines the policies and procedures for Forestry graduate students. Here is a link to the graduate student portal where you will find links to graduate studies advising and links to financial support opportunities among many other resources. Foresty Building Location You can use the UBC wayfinder to locate rooms and buildings on campus. Mailing address: Forestry and Conservation Sciences (FCS) 3041-2424 Main Mall Vancouver B.C. V6T 1Z4 This will go to the FCS reception, so you should talk to Natasha Thompson prior to shipping anything to that address (especially large or expensive items). Building Access Access to individual offices requires a key, which will be requested by FCS reception (see Natasha Thompson) and issued by the Access Desk at the Bookstore, with a $20 security deposit. Students should be provided with an office and should talk to Natasha Thompson for office related inquiries. For access to the building (after hours) as well as the lab room (all hours) and other key-card access rooms, you will need a physical UBC student or staff card. Once you have obtained a physical UBC card, see Natasha Thompson to have it programmed to access the lab room and other rooms you should have access to. For after hours access issues call Campus Security 604 822 2222. Lab Room Our lab room IS 3202 and includes the kitchen facilities, lounge, desks and conference table. Please be considerate of anyone using the desks in the lab room, but feel free to use the room. See above section for access to the lab room - however most of the time a lab member will be in the lab room and you can always knock if you don’t have your UBC card yet! Meeting Rooms Meeting rooms and TA pods can be booked through your UBC Outlook Calendar (web mail or outlook on PC/Mac, will not work on your phone). A list of rooms that are allowed to be booked self-serve is sent out monthly to your UBC email and includes the tech equipment for each room, currently (2024-10-29) this includes: 2101 Meeting room, 8 people 3003 Meeting room, 10 people 3101 Meeting room, 8 people 4001 Meeting room, 18 people 4101 Meeting room, 8 people 2500A/B/C TA Pods In your Outlook calendar you simply fill out the “Location” field (search using “Forestry” as the keyword and then check if room is available). To ensure your booking is accepted, it is recommended that you: to include a brief descriptor for their meeting (i.e. MSc/PhD committee meeting, research lab meeting, etc.) to include their department name and/or supervisor’s name to include their department admin in the CC/Optional Recipient field to assist with granting access to the meeting space (esp. for FSC 4001) Common Spaces The kitchen on level 3 is room 3039. This is available to all staff, students and faculty, but is closed at 4:30 each day. There is a kitchen and dining area on level 4 (room 4003) that is for staff and faculty use only, unless it is booked for an event. Desks and lounge areas include the level 3 landing, and the Treehouse, which is the study space in the atrium with all the plants. Printing/Copying Room 3005 is the copy room for FCS. The printing code assigned to Tara and the lab is 426520, which is charged to Tara’s start-up fund. You may use this code when you need to print something as long as it is a reasonable amount of printing, for very large printing needs talk to Tara or Madeline first. Scanning is free. The easiest way to use the printer/scanner is to use a thumb drive plugged directly into the printer/scanner and using the print/scan to USB mode on the printer. It will print PDFs but not Word docs. For after hours use when the door is locked you can access the key to the printer room by using your key card to get into the lock-box located at the far end of the hallway from the lab room. UBC Online Access Once you have received your student number and your first-time sign in information visit The University of British Columbia to establish your UBC Campus Wide Login (CWL). This CWL is your one place sign in for all of the UBC portals that will be at your disposal. The CDLab manager will send IT (Norm Hodges) and email requesting that you obtain access to the Forestry drives of UBC. They will Cc you in this email as your CWL will be required. The Forestry drives of UBC will give you access to secure data storage spaces and access to the shared lab Z drive. Here is a link to how you can map to this shared drive space. See Shared Digital Workspaces for more details. Be aware that some UBC software, like ArcGIS, only functions when using the UBC VPN – Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. Here is a guide as to how to set up your VPN for remote access away from the UBC campus. For more information on how to access the IT services of UBC (see section 2.1) UBC Social Events Seminars There are regular seminars held during the school year by the Department and open to staff, students and faculty. These include the FCS Wednesday seminar series (and social with coffee!), the IRES (Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability) seminar series. Both of these are emailed to all FCS Forestry staff, faculty and grad students. Lab members have also enjoyed some of the BRC (Biodiversity Research Center) seminar series. To be notified of other seminars and discussions, join email lists email list. Biodiversity Beers Biodiversity Beers is a social event held in the atrium of the Biodiversity Building every Friday at 5pm. All are welcome to attend, and also to volunteer for the buying/serving of drinks. Notifications for the event come through the zoology email list. Hazardous Waste Information about hazardous waste disposal at UBC can be found here. Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are: * Sharps (syringes, razors, blades) * Animal blood * Uncontaminated animal carcasses * Non-indigenous species (includes soil and plants) Disposal of biological waste may require special training. Contact Rolando Descalzo, Collections Manager, for waste disposal inquires (rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca). Sharps disposal containers can be purchased from the Chemistry Store on the corner of Main Mall and University Boulevard using a journal voucher. "],["transportation.html", "Getting to UBC Bus Car Bike From Vancouver Island", " Getting to UBC Bus Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby Skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. The information about U-Pass BC/Compass card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found here. UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC. A Compass card is the most cost-effective way of using Skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass cards can be purchased at vending machines in Skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7eleven outlets. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass card to give unlimited access to Skytrain, Canada Line and SeaBus services. A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include Skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo). Car Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased here. Designated parking stalls are available for car share services. Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative. Bike Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception. From Vancouver Island The 620 bus connects the transit system from Bridgeport station to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal (in both directions). It departs (from both directions) roughly around the hour, and depending on season/time of day it may have multiple busses that leave in 5-10 minute spacing around the hour. Often waiting for the second bus can be a great option if you want to have a seat/space to work on the go - but ensure there will be another bus or you will be waiting for an hour! From Bridgeport to UBC the most efficient routes are taking the skytrain either to Langara-49th station and then the 49 bus towards UBC, or taking the skytrain one stop further to Oakridge-41st and taking the R4 Rapid Bus towards UBC. These routes are also the best in the other direction. It is all ways a good idea to use Google Maps or Apple Maps to plan your route and see how long it will take you, and what route will be most efficient. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station.

They are the central authority and set rules relating to IT and cyber-security. However, Norman Hodges (norman.hodges@ubc.ca) will likely be your most useful resource (especially if you are using a computer owned by the department). Norm is the IT Technician for our department (FCS) within Forestry and can support you when you first join the department in getting your software/laptop set up and if you require support in the future. Some of the main things that Norm may be able to help with include: Ordering computer hardware Installing software (eg. ArcGIS, R, Mendeley) Setting up a connection to the wifi and VPN Mapping the shared network drive Adding devices such as printers Required software updates that you don’t have permission to install Do note that if you are using a UBC owned and operated laptop you will be unable to install (some) software without Norm accessing your desktop remotely (or you taking it to him) and providing admin access to install software. Also note that UBC has strict rules (often under BC law) concerning some types of applications and software, and as such you can expect restricted access to some software. If Norm is unavailable, or you require other support you can reach out to UBC IT or Forestry IT (forestry.ithelp@ubc.ca) the Faculty wide IT service. It is worth noting, however, that Norm’s understanding of our lab-owned computers, the needs within our Faculty, and the specific software many of us use, means more often than not he is the most useful resource when it comes to IT. 0.1 Software dowloads To download software through UBC visit the UBC software downloads portal. You will also visit the same portal when re licensing software, but you will be prompted by email to do so. 0.2 Adobe products UBC is no longer going to cover costs for Adobe Acrobat Pro and Adobe Acrobat Creative Cloud. For those who need Adobe Acrobat Pro (offers you the ability to read and edit PDFs), Tara is happy to cover that annual cost. You will need to purchase an annual subscription (see instructions below) and then submit an out of pocket expense.

The computer itself sits in the lab room 3202, but can be connected to from anywhere you have access to the UBC VPN. Please store any files that you need on the shared drive or the H drive rather than on the 3202a workstation/C drive as this system is reserved for running software that demands lots of memory and RAM. No one user should be taking up more than 10GB. Space usage is monitored. Scheduling time is done through the workstation-booking channel on Slack. You will be admitted to the CD Slack channel upon request by the lab manager. When using the remote workstation please be sure to monitor the slack channel as some lab members leave software running over night. Remote Desktop Connection Connect to the UBC VPN guide on how to connect found here). The application ‘Remote Desktop Connection’ will connect you to the workstation. Access this by searching it in the Start Menu. Enter the link frst-fcs-3202a.ead.ubc.ca and your UBC credentials (ensure the domain is EAD). Once you have logged in for the first time you can create a shortcut to bypass the above steps. With the Remote Desktop Connection window open, click ‘show options’ and then save as to add the shortcut to your desktop or another location. 0.2.0.1 Useful settings Settings are available in the Remote Desktop Connection window under ‘show options’. By default, when you connect to the workstation it will open up on only one of your screens (assuming you have multiple screens). To expand the workstation across your whole computer, tick ‘use all my monitors’ under the display tab. If the connection bar at the top of the screen gets in your way, you can hide it by unticking the box at the bottom of the display tab. To bring the connection bar back temporarily, use ctrl+alt+home. You can also move and shorten the connection bar. To link your local drives and folders to the workstation, go to the local resources tab, then ‘more’, and tick ‘drives’. This will mean that all your folders from your regular computer will be available through the workstation (note that this step will not work on UBC-owned computers due to the way they are configured). To link the lab shared drive, map the drive as you did originally (see lab handbook for instructions). If you are doing a task that requires a lot of power and is causing things to lag, you can reduce the colour depth under the display tab to improve performance. 0.2.0.2 Other things to know Only one person can be logged onto the workstation and using applications at any one time. However, multiple people can also have things running in the background whilst being disconnected, and this can happen while someone else is logged in. For example, two lab members can have code running in R on the workstation while another lab member is logged in and using ArcGIS. Note that anything running in the background may slow down work that someone is doing whilst logged in, and vice versa. To access the task manager (for example, if an application is not responding and you need to end the task), use ctrl+alt+end. Note that ctrl+alt+del will bring up the task manager for your local computer. The default settings keep the clipboard activated, so you can copy and paste between the local computer and the workstation. 0.2.0.3 Logging out/disconnecting DO NOT CLICK SHUT DOWN when using the workstation. Clicking shut down instead of disconnecting or logging out of the computer will turn the device off completely, meaning someone will have to go into the lab and physically turn it back on. This will not be damaging in any way, just an inconvenience, unless another user is running something in the background, then their work will be lost. Disconnecting from the workstation will take you back to your local computer, but the workstation will stay open in the background and whatever tasks you had running will continue. To disconnect, click the cross on the right of the connection bar at the top of the screen. Logging off is the same as for your local computer, i.e. unsaved work will be lost. Log off by clicking on your name under the Start Menu. Please log off whenever you have finished using the workstation. Shared Network Drive The shared network drive for the lab is called T Martin lab network drive, and is stored on the UBC server. It is available to lab members that have a UBC email address and CWL, and can be accessed off-campus via the VPN. Access to this shared drive is managed by Norm Hodges who will require your CWL to ensure your access to the workspace. This drive is capped at 20GB. The shared drive is used for storing files in a central, secure location. It is a useful way to back up files to the UBC server, and to allow large files to be shared with others in the lab instead of emailing them. You can encrypt files on the drive to maintain data security. How to access this shared drive - Instructions on how to map the network drive can be found here. In step 2 of the instructions, login with the domain ‘ead’ and your CWL ID eg. ead. You may need to be on ubcsecure wifi network rather than eduroam to connect to the drive. You can also connect from off campus if you’re on the UBC VPN. If you are having trouble connecting, contact the CDLab manager to ensure that you were given access. If this does not solve the issues contact Norm Hodges to help trouble shoot. Dropbox Shared dropbox folders are used within the CDL to share related files for certain projects. Upon your entry into the lab you will receive an invitation to the CDLab shared folder where you will find an assortment of helpful resources and information regarding the lab including equipment inventory, EDI statement and resources, ect. Slack Slack is a tool used for team communication. It is used for conversation that would otherwise clog our inboxes, such as quick project-related questions, lab events (eg. after work drinks), other events of interest (seminars, presentations etc.) weekly updates and general chit-chat. Documents and calendar invites can be shared in message threads called ‘channels’, with the option to also send private one-on-one messages. Be aware that all lab members do not use Slack equally, so important communications should still be sent via email. Your admittance to the CDLab Slack channel will be granted upon request by either the CDLab manager or another lab member. You will be required to create a Slack account. The app can also be downloaded for free. Github For those who have not yet been introduced to GitHub it is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software. The CDLab has a GitHub repository that can be found here.

This list is currently not up to date and if you are wondering about what equipment is avialble please reach out to Aidan for the time being until the list is updated. If you require the use of any equipment please ensure that you alert Aidan prior to your field work excursions to ensure that the equipment is up to date on repairs and servicing and is accessible to you (is the equipment on Salt Spring or in Vancouver). Dr. Tara Martin, depending on the equipment in question and its function is willing to discuss the purchase of more equipment that could contribute to the overall function of the lab as a whole. Please note that all lab equipment will be inspected before an after use and please use this equipment with care and as if it was your own. Thank you. Laptop Computers The CDLab has a number of laptops currently in circulation (see equipment inventory list), along with desktop monitors, wireless keyboards, mice, and HDMI cords. At the beginning of your appointment please alert the CDLab manager of your computer needs if not prompted. Funding can be made available to purchase additional hardware space, RAM, and higher functioning devices if need be. A list of the devices that are most commonly ordered through UBC can be found here. When a device is being readied to go to a new student you will be asked to provide a list of software that you would like installed. Norm Hodges will pre-load all of the software that he is able to install before you receive this device. While you are in possession of a CDLab/UBC owned and operated laptop you are expected to ensure proper care of the device by observing the following best practices. In general, if you’re prompted to update software, don’t ignore the prompts indefinitely. On the weekend after the second Tuesday of the month (otherwise known as Microsoft Patch Tuesday), do the following: Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Check for updates, allow the laptop to update and restart. If a laptop user doesn’t routinely connect to the UBC VPN, they should connect for an hour or so every couple weeks to ensure Windows and Office licenses are updated and to ensure malware protection is updated. Otherwise, just remember the laptop is a fairly expensive piece of equipment. It’s not a hammer or a crowbar Lab Truck The field truck is available for use by lab members for fieldwork (at a cost to cover gas/maintenance), please discuss with Tara if you think you may want to use it. It is a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with lockable canopy. The designated parking stall in the parking lot below Forestry is #19, but the truck is often stored at Dr. Tara Martin’s lab space on Salt Spring Island and so arrangements to bring it to the mainland for work must be made in advance. There is a UBC fuel card that should be used to fill up the vehicle, and is kept in a plastic sleeve in the glovebox. The purchase will then be charged to the designated project fund upon reconciliation. When using the vehicle, please remember the following: * Fill with fuel at end of use (a use may be multiple days) * Use fuel card in glovebox to fill up and keep receipts Fill out logbook in glovebox at end of use. Research Vessel The lab’s research vessel is a 6.26m outboard Silverstream with a 150 horsepower (HP) Yamaha engine and a 9.9 HP kicker engine dubbed ‘Sea Blush’. The vessel is moored on Salt Spring Island at a private marina in the Fulford Harbor. The vessel will only be operated by qualified operators, Dr. Tara Martin or CDLab manager Abbie Sherwood. When budgeting the use of the research vessel for a project use the ratio of 1 nautical mile to 1$ of gas and maintenance. Marine engines should only be filled with mid-grade gasoline. Please take this information into consideration when budgeting for vessel use during project planning. Projectors The CDLab owns two projectors: a portable one and a ceiling-mounted system in the lab room. The portable projector can be used for meetings and gatherings as needed. The ceiling-mounted projector includes an electronic screen, and both are controlled from the panel to the right of the whiteboard. Contact UBC AV services for any issues with the lab projector set up. UBC Storage Locker The lab has a storage locker in the basement of the forestry building. Ask Aidan for access to this space.

I find it is the most intuitive way to work with the program and the website. There is an installation tutorial here. 2. Clone the Handbook Repository The first time you download a repository from a remote location you are creating a clone (Figure 1). This is the local version of the repository that lives on your computer. It is analogous to adding a shared folder in Dropbox. Figure 1: Cloning the repository to the local device. You will need to be part of the Conservation Decisions Lab Organization to see the available repositories. When you click on the ‘ConservationDecisionsLab/CDL-lab-handbook’ repository it will allow you to select where you would like to save the files locally (Figure 2). This is where you will be working with contents of the Handbook. Figure 2: Selecting the handbook repository and a storage location for the files on your device. Here I am saving the repository in my Documents/Analysis folder. Once you’ve cloned repository you are ready to start editing the files! 3. Workflow for Editing the Handbook 3.1 Pull the latest version of repository This should always be your first step when you are beginning to work on a new edit for the manual. This step essentially downloads any changes that may have been made by others. You can think of it like manually asking Dropbox for the latest version of a document that was edited by a collaborator, but rather than one specific document, GitHub tracks changes across the entire repository. In GitHub Desktop you can sync your files by clicking on Fetch origin (Figure 3). Figure 3: Fetch origin should always be the place to start to make sure you are working with the latest version of the handbook. 3.2 Edit the Files Editing the manual requires some basic understanding of R Studio, Markdown, and Bookdown. These tools allow us to build the web document. The file structure and names are important for functionality of the book. The key elements are highlighted and explained in Figure 4. Each Chapter is its own Markdown (.rmd) file, its number determines its place in the book. The index file acts as the welcome page and defines the formatting of the book. Larger edits to the structure of the book can be done through a re-numbering of the contributing files. Edits to the content of the Chapters themselves can be done by opening the R Project File ‘CDL-lab-handbook’. This will launch RStudio where the individual chapters can be opened and edited. Figure 4: File structure for the lab handbook. R Studio and Markdown The content of the handbook is written in Markdown using RStudio (Figure 5). Markdown is a simple language for editing text. It provides simple conventions for defining headers, incorporating links, inline code, images and more. Markdown relies on a system of symbols to indicate the formatting, rather than applying the formatting and editing the content at the same time like in Word. The formatting is then complied into HTML for visualization at the end. For the purposes of the Lab Handbook we really only need to understand the basics like headers, lists, and images. A helpful guide for the basics of writing in Markdown can be found here. It can also be useful to look at how the existing chapters look in R and see how this translates to the version of the Handbook that is currently online. Figure 5: Editing the content of the Handbook within RStudio. Bookdown Bookdown is the R package that is used to compile all the chapters and format the webpage. When editing for the first time you will have to download this package you can do this through the ‘Packages Tab’ in RStudio or running the command ‘install.packages(“bookdown”)’ in the console (Figure 6). Figure 6: How to install the Bookdown package (only required the first time). With Bookdown installed the final step of adding the changes to the Lab Manual after saving the edits to the .rmd is to recompile the book. You can do this by clicking on ‘Build’ in the top right pane, and then clicking ‘Build Book’ (Figure 7). This takes the changes that have been applied to the Markdown files and generates new HTML files that can be viewed online. Once the book has been built it will open in a pop-up screen and you can check to make sure everything looks right. Figure 7: Building the book compiles the changes made to the individual .rmd files and generates html documents that can be visualized online. 3.3 Push Edits to the Main Branch After making edits and compiling the book, GitHub desktop should show which files have been changed and what those changes are. In Figure 8, you can see that the paragraph that was edited has been highlighted and duplicated in red and green. The red version shows the previous text and the green version shows what it has been changed to. You can see I’ve changed the wording from ‘critical’ to ‘essential’ and that is highlighted within those paragraphs. You will also notice that all the files in the ‘docs/’ folder have been updated. This is due to the Bookdown compilation creating a new version of each file. The actual edits made will only be reflected in the corresponding html document for Chapter 2. Figure 8: Example of changes recorded in GitHub Desktop. The final step before committing and pushing our changes to the remote repository is to write a short comment about the changes that were made (Figure 9). This will help keep track of what was changed and when. Figure 9: Example comment to contextualize the changes that have been made. After noting the changes I’ve made, I can commit the change to the repository by clicking ‘Commit to main’. With the change committed you can now ‘push’ that change to the Remote Repository by clicking ‘Push origin’ (Figure 10). Now others will be able to see the changes that have been made. Figure 10: Push the change to the remote repository. You can create multiple commits before pushing them all at once if you have multiple discrete editing tasks that you would like to accomplish. 4. Collaboration and Conflicts Just like Dropbox can produce conflicted copies when two people are editing the same document, conflicts can occur in Git. To be honest, I’ve never used GitHub collaboratively so I don’t have the best handle on how this works. As long as two people don’t make different edits to the same section of text, GitHub should be able to integrate edits made to different components of the book. There shouldn’t be to many problems with simultaneous editing as, but it will be a learning experience for all of us and we can add what we learn to this section. A Comparative example with Dropbox Below is a table that outlines the steps of collaborating on a document through GitHub and compares them to the functionality of Dropbox. Hopefully this example will help elucidate the general workflow of GitHub, and how the steps provide control over each step of making edits. "],["lab-media-guidelines--.html", "1 Lab Media Guidelines {-#} Terms of Use for Partnered Media and Photography", " 1 Lab Media Guidelines {-#} Terms of Use for Partnered Media and Photography The following terms of use apply to all images, media, and content shared with the Conservation Decisions Lab, as agreed upon with the photographers or media partners. Each project partner must review and approve the terms of use that best fit their needs before sharing any content. The following options are based on Creative Commons licensing, each has varying levels of permissions and protections. General Guidelines for Lab &amp; Media Partners: A Checklist ● Attribution: Always ensure proper credit is given to the photographer or media partner as specified in the agreed-upon terms of use. The exact wording of the credit should be agreed upon beforehand (e.g., photographer’s name, project name, or other relevant identifiers). When publishing or distributing the media, ensure the attribution is clearly legible—whether in print, online, or in presentations. ● Respecting Licensing: The Lab should always include a copy of the agreed-upon license when sharing media with external partners, collaborators, or media outlets to ensure the terms are respected. This minimizes any confusion or misuse of the media and ensures that all parties are aware of the legal boundaries for usage. For example, if an image is licensed for non- commercial use only (i.e to promote research) that condition must be communicated clearly to any third party. ● Consent for Additional Use: For any use of the media outside the scope of the original agreement (particularly commercial uses, such as being sold to a third-party media outlet), explicit written consent must be obtained from the photographer or media partner. This includes reselling the work, licensing it for new purposes, or sharing it with organizations not initially covered in the agreement. Always ensure that photographers are fully aware and compensated (if applicable) for any commercial uses. Types of Licensing Agreements 1. Attribution (CC BY 4.0) This license allows for the broadest use of media, permitting others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given to the original photographer. Terms: You must credit the original photographer as specified by them. You may not imply that the photographer endorses your use. Media may be used for both Lab-related and non-Lab-related stories, provided the above conditions are met. 2. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) This license permits others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work, but only for non- commercial purposes. Any derivative works must also acknowledge the original photographer. Terms: Media may only be used for non-commercial purposes (i.e., no resale or monetization). You must credit the original photographer in any public or digital use. Any alterations to the work must also provide credit to the original creator. Media shared by the Lab may not be used in third-party commercial media outlets without additional consent. 3. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) This license allows others to download and share the work as-is, but they cannot make any changes or use it commercially. Terms: Media must remain unchanged and cannot be adapted or altered. Use is restricted to non-commercial purposes only. Proper attribution is required when the media is shared or published. The Lab may distribute the media for educational or Lab-related content only. Any third-party use must receive explicit consent from the photographer. 4. Custom Commercial Agreement For media used in commercial outlets (such as major news organizations or publications), the Lab may negotiate specific terms with the photographer that go beyond standard Creative Commons licenses. Terms: Any media shared for commercial use must receive the photographer’s written consent and terms. A fee may be required for commercial use or resale of the work. Proper credit must be provided, and the terms of the commercial agreement should be adhered to strictly. 5. Lab-Specific Use Only (Custom License) In this scenario, the photographer grants the Lab the right to use their media exclusively for internal and educational purposes or in Lab-related content. This is not a Creative Commons license but a tailored agreement. Terms: Media can only be used for Lab-related publications, presentations, and projects. Media cannot be shared with external media outlets or used commercially. The photographer retains full copyright and control over the distribution of their work beyond the Lab. Social Media When sharing images or media on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or similar outlets, it’s important to acknowledge the unique challenges of crediting and maintaining control over the distribution of content. Given the ease of reposting or resharing on these platforms, the following guidelines can help ensure that proper credit is consistently maintained. 1. Embedding Credits in the Image: One of the most effective ways to ensure credit is retained when content is reshared is by embedding the photographer’s or creator’s name directly into the image or video. This can be done subtly but visibly—such as in a corner of the photo or within the frame of a video. The credit should be legible without distracting from the image itself. Example: A watermark in the bottom right corner that reads: “Photo by [Photographer’s Name]” or “[Photographer’s Handle].” 2. Including Credits in Captions: When posting on Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms, always include the proper credits in the caption. Tag the photographer or creator’s social media handle (if applicable) and add a clear mention of their contribution. Example Caption: “Captured by the amazing @PhotographerHandle to highlight critical Marsh Biodiversity #PhotoCredit #ArtistName” 3. Respecting Platform Limitations: Some social media platforms (like Instagram Stories) have shorter lifespans for posts, making embedded or visible credits essential. Whenever you are posting temporary media (e.g., Stories or Reels), ensure the photographer or creator is credited in the overlay text or in any supplementary captioning that appears with the media. 4. Permissions for Social Media Use: If the photographer or creator has not explicitly agreed to social media distribution, make sure you get their permission before posting. Social media may be considered a separate usage category, especially if there is potential for commercial gain through resharing or promotion. 5. Responding to Reposts Without Credit: In cases where an image or media piece is reshared without credit, kindly request that the person or outlet that reshared the content either adds the proper attribution or takes the post down if credit cannot be given. Example Message: “Thank you for sharing this image! Please make sure to credit the original photographer, [Photographer’s Name/Handle], as it’s part of our terms of use.” By embedding credits directly into images or videos and consistently using clear captions, we can better ensure that photographers and creators are credited properly, even as their work circulates across various social media platforms.
