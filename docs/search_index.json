"],["diversity.html", "JEDI Policy Our Statement Our Values Our Commitment to Action Best Practices in Research Cultural Awareness Additional Resources", " JEDI Policy The Conservation Decisions Lab—led by Dr. Tara Martin—has worked as a team to develop this Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) policy. Each year, we come together to review the policy and make changes in response to changing needs, social and cultural contexts, and understanding of JEDI principles and how they apply to our work and our daily lives. Throughout the year, lab members also engage in discussions and share information about available learning opportunities, such as articles, seminars, workshops, or resources, to deepen our understanding of these principles and how to embody them in our actions. Our Statement We recognize the colonial contexts of conservation and academia, both past and present, and the systemic inequities that prevail. We see it as our responsibility to encourage, include, and make way for underrepresented and marginalized voices and perspectives; meaningfully collaborate with and support the work of Indigenous communities; and communicate our research to a broad cross-section of society across all demographics. We commit to decolonizing the work that we do, from the questions that we pose to the manner in which we undertake our research and communicate the outcomes. We commit to using our privilege to actively address any barriers or injustices witnessed in our work and daily life. We commit to working in a self-reflective and critical manner, and adapting and improving our actions to ensure our impacts align with the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Our lab is committed to recruiting and collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity is critical for transforming us into better students, teachers, scientists, conservation practitioners, and members of all communities. The challenges we face in conservation and as a society at large—whether they be related to biodiversity, climate change, and/or JEDI—require a shared understanding, novel perspectives, and transformative actions. We are actively working to reduce barriers to diverse representation in our research, in conservation, and in academia. Through this process, we aim to share knowledge, experience, and insight with each other that can be applied to our future workplaces, many of which share similar legacies of systemic inequality. We acknowledge that our lab—centered at UBC Vancouver—is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.The land where UBC is situated has always been a place of learning where people for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next. Members of our lab engage in research on this land, as well as in the territories of other First Nations in BC and Indigenous communities across Canada. We have a duty to reflect on the nature of our work and reconcile it with the history and ongoing nature of colonialism, academic research, and Indigenous dispossession. It is our intent to foster meaningful relationships with the communities whose lands we are working on and engage in a research process that is beneficial to and is anchored by the values, goals, and interests of those communities and is conducted in the spirit of reciprocity. We acknowledge that each of us may be at different points throughout our journey in learning, listening, and cultivating an inclusive academic environment and that mistakes can be made. We also understand how important it is to learn from those mistakes and to not let fear of making a mistake be an excuse for inaction. To guide our journey, we are committed to continuously revisiting these values and updating this JEDI statement as a living document. Our Values We value diversity of identities, knowledge systems, and worldviews in our lab and community. We value a lab culture whereby we can reflect on our personal and collective identities, both as researchers and as colleagues. This means we are actively acknowledging the intersecting privilege and/or barriers that we may or may not experience associated with our identities. We value acceptance. Discrimination (e.g., unjust treatment on the basis of sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, national origin, education level, physical and mental ability, age, physical appearance, or political views) in any form will not be tolerated within this space. Derogatory or hurtful comments are not acceptable, and all lab members are encouraged to initiate discussion when inappropriate behaviour or language is observed. We value accountability in supporting and nurturing a culture of safety within our team. All members of our team commit to creating a safe, supportive, respectful, and inviting community. We value an ongoing and iterative journey of learning. We recognize the continuous commitment to (un)learning needed to build a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive community. We commit to translating these values into action and carrying them out in our work and daily life. Our Commitment to Action Individual Actions Recognize and reflect on one’s own bias and privilege. Recognize privilege (e.g., status or experience) as a responsibility to provide space for underrepresented or overlooked contributors before ourselves. Devote time to continue learning about JEDI issues, working through provided JEDI materials, sourcing new materials, and contributing to the lab’s JEDI resource library. Practice deep listening to ensure we are working with peers and collaborators in a meaningful way, rather than dictating or projecting our needs onto others. Welcome critiques of our words and actions, and remain open to engaging in uncomfortable conversations that are integral to change. Complete UBC’s conflict engagement course here. Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent the diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Include local knowledge holders, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research during study design, questions, analyses, and writing. Communicate and provide research outputs to those involved in and affected by the research and possible decisions influenced by this research. Commit to open science and data sharing when appropriate (*e.g.8, with permission for any data that might be sensitive). Maintain epistemic humility and scrutinize methods, concepts, and questions using a multi-dimensional lens. Use inclusive pronouns and language. Be willing to share ideas, projects, and concepts with others. Recognize the Nations whose lands we conduct our research on, and include them meaningfully in all steps of our research process. Lab Community Actions Use this document as a social contract to foster a safe space within our lab community. Actively update this document to reflect new perspectives and growth annually during lab events. Devote time to discussing JEDI materials, including JEDI-focused activities and group exercises, during lab events. Provide resources for members to attend JEDI courses, training, and workshops. Continuously build and update the online and physical JEDI learning library in the lab. Invite speakers, panels, authorship, and committees to better represent a diversity of perspectives and lived experiences. Facilitate discussion aimed to educate and encourage lab members on the best practices of including local knowledge holders, community groups, practitioners, and scientists from other disciplines in our research. Ensure that lab events are inclusive, accessible and safe for all lab members by providing multiple event options for venues and activities. Discuss one’s own and others’ research in the context of our JEDI values to ensure our research aligns with the values and best practices outlined in this document. Best Practices in Research We are committed to building our fluency and capacity in the following areas to facilitate best practices in JEDI in our research: Acknowledging power and vulnerabilities Follow best practices in JEDI in hiring and retainment, and encourage the department to follow suite Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in grad student/postdoc applications Provide basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Participate in basic JEDI training when involved in a hiring process Confronting harassment in the workplace Committing to transparency and accountability to the implications of our works E.g., Who benefits, who is impacted? Titleholder and stakeholder engagement throughout the research process Clarity around ownership and control of data Fairly acknowledging contributions Encourage reflexivity and positionality statements in your work and research Committing to accessibility E.g., Communicating our research to diverse audiences Open access data (where appropriate), code, and publications Examining reward systems within and beyond academia (e.g., what constitutes “good” research questions, reward systems for research participants) Equitable hiring relative to opportunities (e.g., consider paid positions vs volunteers, make space early and often for conversations around additional resources and capacity for hiring graduate students and PDFs) Decolonizing our approach to research E.g., Fostering collaborative approaches to co-developing research, practicing accountability (e.g., “helicopter research”), and being open to timeframes and reward systems outside of academia Access training for appropriate ethics (e.g., UBC and Nation/community-specific intake processes), communication, and decolonizing “Doing our homework” - knowing where we work and the historical context of the systems we get to work in Be open and curious to multiple ways of knowing, learning, and communicating Daylighting health and wellness Prioritizing our own and each other’s mental health in grad school Openly discussing / holding space for health and wellness obstacles, personally and professionally (i.e., in academic spaces) Celebrating success beyond the h-index and the awards list! Cultural Awareness Dr. Tara Martin encourages and supports lab members to take time to learn about the many cultures within and around Vancouver and the Point Grey Campus, as well as the areas wherein research is conducted and beyond. You will notice that a land acknowledgment is common practice during introductions. UBC provides a guide to assist those new to the land acknowledgment practice, and we encourage all lab members to participate in this brief yet vital ‘Respect, Sincerity &amp; Responsibility: Land Acknowledgements @ UBC’ course. Enroll here. This course is part of the UBC Centre for Teaching and Learning’s Indigenous Learning Pathways program, which aims to support new employees to meaningfully and respectfully engage with Indigenous histories, knowledges, perspectives, and realities in their role at UBC. For additional guides on land acknowledgements, see our JEDI resource list. We also highly recommend and encourage enrolling in the ‘Indigenous Canada’ course offered by the University of Alberta and hosted by Coursera, which provides effective context to Canada’s history of colonization. This is a great course and is expected to take 21 hours to complete. For those looking to learn about and improve their cultural competence, the Cultural Competence Training site may also be a useful starting point for your journey. Additional Resources As a part of our JEDI commitment we have curated a list of JEDI-related learning resources. This is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. We encourage all lab members to add to this list. Thank you in advance for contributing material that you believe will assist in our collective education. UBC also provides a variety of resources and support: The Faculty of Forestry has a number of JEDI Initiatives, provides resources and steps for harassment or discrimination complaints, and curates a list of self-directed JEDI learning resources. The Equity and Inclusion Office provides info and links to services, help, and resources available to the UBC community. The Centre for Teaching and Learning offers Anti-Racist Teaching and Learning programming for staff and faculty, including a list of resources. "],["commitments.html", "Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings 1-on-1 Meetings Staff Meetings Lab Retreat", " Lab Member Commitments Lab Meetings All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every three weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually via Zoom. Currently, Tara teaches each week during the fall semester and is able to attend lab meetings in person, however may not be able to do so as regularly during the spring semester. It is strongly encouraged that all lab members attend in-person whenever possible as lab meetings offer a valuable opportunity to engage with other lab members and helps to foster a sense of community within the lab. However, we understand that circumstances differ amongst lab members and this may not always be possible. Lab meetings present a valuable opportunity for lab members to practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defenses and receive feedback from lab members. Additionally, students might use lab meetings to showcase their current work, or work that they have done in the past. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. CDL has also hosted joint lab meetings to build relationships with other labs. Lab members are expected to take turns leading lab meetings. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found here. This file also includes ideas for future meeting topics as well as a record of past lab meeting topics. The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined, the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab members by Madeline who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting. As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our JEDI statement, these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for JEDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone else’s, but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so. Furthermore, we will review our JEDI statement and commitments as a lab on an annual basis to ensure that this statement adapts as we gain new lab members and as our collective knowledges &amp; understandings continue to develop. 1-on-1 Meetings Lab members will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. Madeline will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester, according to each person’s availability, and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to Madeline (madelinewoodley22@gmail.com). Staff Meetings CDL staff meet for one hour every three weeks (on lab meeting &amp; 1-on-1 weeks). These meetings offer staff an opportunity to check-in and discuss topics related to lab operations and staff-led projects. Madeline will schedule these meetings at the start of each semester according to the availability of the staffing team. Lab Retreat CDL aims to host an annual lab retreat over the summer, based on group availability. In 2024 and 2025 lab retreats have been hosted on Salt Spring Island (see here for past years’ itineraries), however input regarding alternative locations is always welcome. All lab members are encouraged to make lab retreat attendance a priority, as this is a valuable opportunity for relationship-building and informal conversations around mental health, degree &amp; career planning, and more. Lab Retreat 2024 "],["newvancouver.html", "Moving to BC Housing Finances Provincial Services Driving Events Statutory Holidays", " Moving to BC This is by no means an exhaustive list of tips and tricks for those who are new to the great city of Vancouver. Many of our lab members are from elsewhere in Canada and the world and have gone through the process of moving and settling in Vancouver, and will be happy to give tips. We urge for you to communicate via our slack, email, or in person with other lab members who live in Vancouver and who will be able to provide more information and suggestions on how to enjoy the city to its fullest extent. If you are moving to BC from outside of Canada, you may need to obtain a student or work visa prior to arrival. It is best to apply as soon as you have been accepted to allow for lengthy processing times. See the Canadian Immigration and Citizenship website for information about VISA applications and renewals, working while studying, and staying in Canada post-graduation. See also UBC Student Services Immigration Guide for International Students. Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) may also be able to help get you in touch with a UBC immigration lawyer. Information and other helpful resources on moving to and settling in BC are available from the BC Government website, for those moving from outside Canada and from another province within Canada. Some information about relocating to BC are also available from the UBC HR website. Housing It is worth knowing that in BC, lease periods begin on the 1st of the month and sometimes on the 15th. The term of lease agreement varies from month to month, three months, 6 months, and a year. Note that many landlords will ask for references and/or proof of income as part of the rental application. For those who are new to renting, the Housing and Tenancy page on the BC government website provides great resources on how to ensure that you legally protect yourselves as a tenant. It is highly recommended to ensure that your landlord provides you with a lease agreement, regardless of history or personal connections. Feel free to use the CDL Slack group to ask other lab members about the process of housing in Vancouver. Here are some resources for finding housing in Vancouver: For information about on-campus residences at UBC Vancouver, see the UBC Student Housing website Other resources include Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Used Vancouver There are also Facebook groups that advertise rentals, sublets and housemates, including Vancouver Rentals and Roommates, For Rent Vancouver, Vancouver Apartments/Houses for Rent/Roommates, Vancouver Buy/Sell Fast, and Aussies in Vancouver Some have also had success by walking the neighborhoods they are interested in looking for vacancy signs out the front of buildings Finances For opening bank accounts in BC, here are some helpful tips. Make sure you bring sufficient ID if opening an account in person! There are many options for banks—including Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, TD Bank, RBC, Vancity, and more. For information on filing taxes in BC &amp; Canada, check out the UBC Tax Filing information page as well as the BC CRA information pages. Important steps and considerations include: Apply for Social Insurance Number (SIN), in which you must have a work permit or a study permit which includes a condition to work on and/or off campus. If you are not eligible for a SIN, apply for an Individual Tax Number (ITN), necessary for student scholarship. Likely tax documents for students in Canada/BC are T2202, T4, T4A, which you can download from Workday. The Canadian tax system is based on your residency status, not citizenship. You can file online, by paper, by mail, or with accounts, with more information on if you need to file and how to file here. For support you can access the UBC Tax Assistance Clinic (UBC TACS), CRA Free tax clinics, or other resources. Note that you may have to file taxes both in Canada and your country of citizenship. Depending on the country, there are some tax agreements in place to prevent double-taxation. This may require filing additional forms when filing taxes for one or both countries. Provincial Services Depending on your residency status, you may need to apply for a BC Services Card upon arrival to access provincial services, including health care. For information on health insurance in BC, check out the UBC Health Insurance page. Important steps include: Apply for BC’s Medical Services Plan (MSP) upon arrival in BC There is a three month waiting period for MSP coverage to start, so have private medical insurance if you are an international student (iMED). For Canadian students moving from outside BC, you should be covered by your former provincial health care plan during the waiting period. For students, you will be automatically enrolled in AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, and at the start of the academic year as you are automatically charged the AMS/GSS Health and Dental fee For postdocs/staff: depending on your appointment, you may be eligible for Extended Health and Dental Benefits. Enrollment will be done as part of your staff onboarding process. Driving For driving in BC, there are a couple of options, including the following to consider: Upon arrival in BC, you have 90 days to switch your existing license over to a BC one, if needed. NOTE that full-time students may be exempt from this rule. Consult the ICBC website for more information about the process, including eligibility and required documentation. If you are moving from outside Canada, it is best to prepare the required documentation prior to your arrival. Car registration and insurance is a fairly straightforward process with most information on the ICBC site about registration and insurance, but consider the following: You have 30 days to register, license, and insure your vehicle after arriving in BC Book an appointment (or show up) with your nearest autoplan broker (provide ICBC services) for registering and insuring your car. There is one in Wesbrook Village that is very close to UBC. Make sure you have proof of driving experience (abstract or license) already sent directly to ICBC for drivers license as well as bring additional identification. Note that it is significantly cheaper to have insurance in BC if you have a long driving record (sent to ICBC) and if you already get a BC license before registering your car and getting insurance. Importing a car to BC is difficult and involves many steps but is possible with perseverance. There is extensive information provided here about the steps and the forms needed. You will need to import it officially across the border and get it inspected before registration. Note that if you are a U.S. citizen bringing your car to the province and are enrolled full-time at a recognized B.C educational institution, you won’t need to register your vehicle. Just apply for a non-resident exemption permit within 30 days of your arrival so that you can drive here. This permit allows you to continue using the registration, license and insurance coverage from your home state, for as long as you’re studying here. However, not many insurance companies are willing to insure cars in Canada, so you will need to hunt for one, although your car will be insured in Canada for up to 6 months of recreational travel if you are bringing short-term. If you have a valid driving license but do not own (nor wish to own) a vehicle, you may be able to sign up for car sharing services, such as Evo or Modo. Events There are many festivals and events throughout the year in Vancouver. Some that are recommended by lab members are: Cherry Blossom Festival (April) Celebration of Light (July) Vancouver Folk Music Festival (July) Pride (BC Day weekend, August) Vancouver International Film Festival [VIFF] (September) Fringe Festival (September) Westward Music festival (September) Vancouver Christmas Market (November-December) Statutory Holidays Statutory holidays recognized as paid holidays by UBC can be found listed here. "],["transportation.html", "Navigating UBC Getting To UBC Getting Around UBC", " Navigating UBC Getting To UBC Bus Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. The information about U-Pass BC/Compass Card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found here. UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC, though it is possible to opt out of this service if you can prove that you live outside of the Lower Mainland. A Compass Card is the most cost-effective way of using skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass Cards can be purchased at vending machines in skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7-Eleven locations. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass Card to give unlimited access to bus, skytrain, and SeaBus services. A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo). Car Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased here. Designated parking stalls are available for car share services. Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative. Bike Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception. From Vancouver Island The 620 bus connects the transit system from Bridgeport station to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal (in both directions). It departs (from both directions) roughly around the hour, and depending on season/time of day it may have multiple buses that leave in 5-10 minute spacing around the hour. Often waiting for the second bus can be a great option if you want to have a seat/space to work on the go - but ensure there will be another bus or you will be waiting for an hour! From Bridgeport to UBC the most efficient routes are taking the skytrain either to Langara-49th station and then the 49 bus towards UBC, or taking the skytrain one stop further to Oakridge-41st and taking the R4 Rapid Bus towards UBC. These routes are also the best in the other direction. It is all ways a good idea to use Google Maps or Apple Maps to plan your route and see how long it will take you, and what route will be most efficient. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station. Getting Around UBC You can use the UBC Wayfinder to locate rooms and buildings on campus. The Forest Sciences Centre (FSC) is the home of the Faculty of Forestry and will likely be where you spend a great deal of your time at UBC.

Graduate students should review the Graduate Student Portal and the Graduate Student Handbook created by UBC Forestry. Staff should review the UBC Onboarding Checklist. Staff will also need to complete the Forest &amp; Conservation Sciences | New Worker Onboarding &amp; Training Form. Setting Up CWL and FASmail Students will have created a CWL account when applying to UBC, but should ensure their student email accounts are working, if they wish to use them. Contact Forestry IT (forestry.ithelp@ubc.ca or using the UBC Self Service Portal) if you encounter problems or have questions. Staff who are new to UBC will need to create a CWL account; you will receive an email from UBC IT with instructions to create this account once your employment agreement has been signed. For staff who have previously been employed by UBC, your old CWL account will be reactivated once you employment agreement has been signed. In both cases, you will also receive an email from IT regarding your FASmail account (staff email account, hosted by Outlook) which you can access here by logging in with your CWL credentials. UBC Card &amp; Building Access Both staff and students will need to apply for a UBC card if they do not already have one. Students can apply for a UBC student card here. Note that UBC now offers students both digital and physical cards. Staff can apply for a UBC staff card here. Once you have obtained your card, you will need to contact Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) to get the necessary building access (you will at least need access to the FSC building, storage cage in the basement of FSC, lab room in FSC 3202, shared wet lab space in FSC 3231, 3rd floor kitchen, and 3rd floor printing room). Tara will need to approve your access so either CC her in your email to Pedro or have Tara email Pedro directly. If appropriate to your role, staff should also talk to Tara about being added to her faculty account with the UBC Bookstore (can be used to restock lab supplies at a discount). Generally, the Forest Sciences Center (FSC) requires card access after 5pm and on weekends. See After Hours Access for more information. Workday Since 2024, Workday has become the primary platform for UBC processes. This is where you will register for courses, complete necessary workplace training, and submit reimbursement claims, among other things. Workday Onboarding &amp; Training At the start of your appointment, you will receive emails from Workday (and Pedro) prompting you to complete the necessary onboarding tasks and workplace training modules. Benefit Elections (Staff) For staff, it is important that at the start of your appointment you enroll in benefits and complete your benefit elections. Workday, and Pedro, will prompt you to do so, but you should still be aware that this is a necessary step and must be completed early on in your appointment. To review what benefits you are eligible for, visit the UBC HR website and explore the plan associated with your employment group. Also, you should familiarize yourself with UBC Perks for Faculty &amp; Staff. FSC Building Orientation If based in Vancouver, you will spend a great deal of your time in the Forest Sciences Centre. This is the home of UBC’s Faculty of Forestry and houses our lab room (FSC 3202), our shared wet lab space (FSC 3231), Tara’s office (FSC 4607), Forestry grad student offices, study spaces, lecture theatres, and more. The Conservation Decisions Lab belongs to the Forest &amp; Conservation Sciences (FCS) department and primarily occupy the 3rd floor. Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) also offers incoming staff/student/faculty tours of the Forestry building if desired.

Lab Room (FSC 3202) The lab room (FSC 3202) is a shared workplace and all lab members should feel welcome to use the space, with the understanding that our research techs (Riley, Aidan, &amp; Madeline) use this room as their shared office. Please be respectful of this by being quiet if folks are working and/or in meetings, cleaning up after yourself, and helping replenish supplies you use often (honour system). The lab room has a kitchen space with various appliances, including a fridge, kettle, microwave, panini press, drip coffee machine, and espresso machine (find espresso machine instructions here). Generally, the room is also stocked with milk, coffee (caffeinated &amp; decaf), tea, honey, and chocolate. All lab members are welcome and encouraged to use these supplies, but please contribute by keeping things clean and restocked! In terms of work-related supplies/equipment, the lab room is equipped with a white-board and two projectors (one portable and one ceiling-mounted). The portable projector can be used for meetings and gatherings as needed (see cabinet labelled “CDL Tech Equipment” in FSC 3202. The ceiling-mounted projector includes an electronic screen, and both are controlled from the panel to the right of the whiteboard. Notify one of the research techs for any issues with the lab projector set up, or contact UBC AV services. The lab room also hosts two high-powered desktop computers which can be helpful when running large datasets and can be accessed remotely. This is available to all lab members, just make sure it is not in use before accessing it. For more information, ask Riley (riley.finn@ubc.ca). There are various office supplies and tech accessories in the lab room – cupboards &amp; drawers are labelled, and you can ask the research techs if you require something specific. Finally, the lab room houses our lab library (shelves on the wall above Madeline &amp; Aidan’s workspaces). Folks are welcome to borrow from this library (see inventory here) and use the sign-out sheet on the freezer when you borrow/return a book. Specimen Freezer There is a specimen freezer in the lab room that is available for storing biological samples. We are hoping to move this to the wet lab space or basement in the near future and will update the location accordingly. The fridge for storing food is under the bench in the kitchen area. Please keep food and samples separate! UBC Storage Locker The lab has a storage locker in the basement of FSC where some of our field equipment is stored. Ask Aidan or Madeline if you require access to this space. Tara’s Office (FSC 4607) Tara’s office is located on the fourth floor (FSC 4607). This is where you will go to have your 1-on-1 meeting, unless Tara is joining via Zoom. Shared Wet Lab Space (FSC 3231) We have recently been welcomed by Dr. Jennifer Grenz (Indigenous Ecology Lab) and Dr. Tahia Devisscher (Resilient &amp; Innovative Societies &amp; Ecosystems Lab, or RISE Lab) to share their wet lab space in FSC 3231. This is a new development and we are early in the process of working out sharing agreements amongst the three labs. If you require access to the wet lab space, please connect with Tara and Madeline to discuss. Student Offices All graduate students should receive their own desk in one of the shared student offices in FSC. Currently CDL occupies two office spaces on the third floor (not including the lab room). It is advised that students first reach out to Madeline to see whether there is a desk space available in one of these two rooms, and if not students should connect with Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) to get set up with a desk space on the third floor. Common Spaces Forestry Graduate Student Lounge (FSC 1715) The FGSA has a small student lounge (FSC 1715) on the main floor of the building, toward the end of the long hallway behind the Tim Horton’s Restaurant. This room is exclusively for Forestry grad student use. The lounge has comfortable seating, as well as an eating area and small kitchen. FGSA funds have been used to furnish and maintain this room. Please respect the space and your graduate colleagues by leaving the room cleaner than you found it, particularly in the kitchen area. UBC custodial staff do not clean or maintain the lounge. The lounge door has a coded lock and this room is only for Forestry graduate students. If you need the code, please email forestry.cbm@ubc.ca Meeting Rooms Meeting rooms and TA pods can be booked through your UBC Outlook Calendar (must be done via computer). A list of rooms that are allowed to be booked self-serve is sent out monthly to your UBC email and includes the tech equipment for each room, currently (2024-10-29) this includes: 2101 Meeting room, 8 people 3003 Meeting room, 10 people 3101 Meeting room, 8 people 4001 Meeting room, 18 people 4101 Meeting room, 8 people 2500A/B/C TA Pods In your Outlook calendar you simply fill out the “Location” field (search using “Forestry” as the keyword and then check if room is available). To ensure your booking is accepted, it is recommended that you: to include a brief descriptor for their meeting (i.e., MSc/PhD committee meeting, research lab meeting, etc.) to include their department name and/or supervisor’s name to include their department admin in the CC/Optional Recipient field to assist with granting access to the meeting space (especially for FSC 4001) Forestry Staff Lounge (FSC 4003) The staff lounge is located on the fourth floor in FSC 4003. This space is equipped with a kitchen and seating for use by staff. Please be respectful as this is a shared space. This room is often booked for events, so make sure to keep an eye our for emails from Forestry Reception regarding lounge &amp; kitchen availability. Kitchen &amp; Mail Room (FSC 3039) The third floor kitchen (FSC 3039) is available to students, staff and faculty in the Forest &amp; Conservation Sciences Department. This room is equipped with a fridge, sink and microwave for shared use. Please be respectful as this is a shared space. This also serves as the mail room, should staff need to pick up anything on Tara’s behalf. Should you require access to this room after 5pm, see After Hours Access for information. Printing Room (FSC 3005) FSC 3005 is home to a shared printer machine for use by members of the Forest &amp; Conservation Sciences Department. Scanning is free but printing will require a code which charges ink and paper costs to a Worktag associated with each lab. Our printing code is 4-2-6-5-2-0. Please use printing services consciously and let Tara or Madeline know if you anticipate incurring high printing costs. Should you require access to this room after 5pm, see After Hours Access for information. After Hours Access The FSC building is locked after 5pm - this includes exterior and interior doors. All students and staff should automatically receive after hours access with their UBC cards, but should confirm with Pedro. Shared rooms, such as the third floor printing room and kitchen are also locked at 5pm and are not accessible by key cards. To access these two rooms after hours, you will need to visit the lockbox located outside FSC 3301 (on your left at the end of the hallway from our lab room (FSC 3202), headed East). There you will find a big grey box mounted on the wall. To access the key to the mail and printer rooms, use the black card scanner to scan your UBC card and unlock the lockbox. When you open the cabinet door, the keys you have access will light up in red and the screen outside the lockbox will tell you which rooms they are associated with. For most people, only the one key will light up and will show up as PRINT/KIT/MAIL. Pull this key out and close the cabinet door. Use this key to unlock whichever of the rooms you require and make sure the door is locked when you are finished. Scan your card to open the lockbox and insert the key back in its designated spot (highlighted in red) and close the lockbox door. If you do not return the key, FCS admin will contact you as your name will register as the last person to have accessed the key. For after hours access issues call Campus Security 604 822 2222. See also Safety at UBC. Work Supplies &amp; Technology Each lab member should ensure they have the necessary work materials/equipment (before purchasing anything new, email Madeline if you require a work computer, monitor, or other work equipment as the lab may have extras available). There are several on-campus options for acquiring necessary work supplies (i.e., stationary, tech accessories), including Staples (101-2135 Allison Rd) and the UBC Bookstore (6200 University Boulevard). Norman Hodges (norman.hodges@ubc.ca) keeps an up-to-date record of available laptops for our lab. If you are using a lab-owned computer, Norm will hold admin privileges and oversee maintenance so please direct computer-related questions to him. If you are working remotely, it is possible to request admin privileges but you will need to coordinate this with Norm. Funding can be made available to purchase additional hardware space, RAM, and higher functioning devices if need be; if required, please connect with Tara to discuss. A list of the devices that are most commonly ordered through UBC can be found here. If/while you are in possession of a lab-owned laptop you are expected to ensure proper care of the device by observing the following best practices (see below). In general, if you’re prompted to update software, don’t ignore the prompts indefinitely. On the weekend after the second Tuesday of the month (otherwise known as Microsoft Patch Tuesday), do the following: Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Check for updates, allow the laptop to update and restart. If a laptop user doesn’t routinely connect to the UBC VPN, they should connect for an hour or so every couple weeks to ensure Windows and Office licenses are updated and to ensure malware protection is updated. Otherwise, just remember the laptop is a fairly expensive piece of equipment. It’s not a hammer or a crowbar ;-) Software UBC offers students, staff and faculty a number of software licenses for free, or at a discount. If you require a software that is not offered for free through UBC, please discuss with Tara to determine whether this is something that can be covered. If you are working on a lab-owned computer you will need to provide Norm with a list of the software you require as he holds administrative privileges to lab-owned computers and will need to download most software applications on your behalf. The UBC On the Hub website is a good first point of reference to check what licenses are available to you through your UBC affiliation, though there are a number of commonly-used licenses not listed. If you have questions regarding a specific software, Norm (norman.hodges@ubc.ca) or Madeline are good points of contact. See below for information on how to access commonly-requested software licenses: Adobe Acrobat UBC no longer covers the cost of Adobe Acrobat Pro and Adobe Acrobat Creative Cloud. For those who need Adobe Acrobat Pro (offers you the ability to read and edit PDFs), Tara is happy to cover that annual cost. You will need request a Worktag from Madeline in order to purchase an annual subscription at UBC On the Hub. If you use and need Adobe Creative Cloud, please connect with Tara or Madeline to discuss. Note that the annual cost for users will be: Adobe Acrobat Reader: Free Adobe Acrobat Pro: $38.00 Adobe Creative Cloud: $129.50 ArcGIS Pro ArcGIS Pro licenses are offered for free through UBC. Download the software from the ArcGIS website (or ask Norm to do this for you if using a UBC-owned computer) and email gis.forestry@ubc.ca to request an account. We also encourage the installation of QGIS as a great free and open source alternative to ArcGIS. OneDrive OneDrive licenses are offered for free through UBC. See the IT Website for instructions and contact Norm if you have questions. Zoom Zoom business licenses (unlimited call times) are offered for free through UBC. Download the software from the Zoom Website and visit the UBC Self Service Portal to submit a request with the UBC IT (Request A Service &gt; Request Access to an IT Service &gt; fill in ticket). Academic Calendar The UBC Academic Calendar outlines term start/end dates, course drop/withdrawal deadlines, exam periods, and fall/spring reading break dates. See here to view statutory holidays observed by UBC. Waste Management The FSC building has compost, recycling, and garbage programs which are managed by the University. Bins are located in hallways throughout the building and have signage to inform sorting. Garbage bins in office and lab rooms are emptied by janitorial staff, but compost and recycling must be emptied by room occupants into the relevant hallway bins. If disposing of hazardous waste (e.g., sharps), please contact Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) or Rolando Descalzo (rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca) for guidance on appropriate procedures. Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are: Sharps (syringes, razors, blades) Animal blood Uncontaminated animal carcasses Introduced species (includes soil and plants) Sharps disposal containers can be purchased from the Chemistry Store on the corner of Main Mall and University Boulevard using a journal voucher. If offloading items that are still in working condition but no longer required, there are a couple of avenues for rehoming. For items that have high relevance to other Forestry members, a first step would be to contact Pedro about circulating an email out to Faculty of Forestry mailing lists to gauge interest. Other options include Rheaply, which can be signed into with your UBC email, Facebook Marketplace, or a local thrift store. Probationary Assessment (Staff) If your contract extends beyond one year, ensure you complete a probationary assessment with Tara at the start of your renewed contract. Talk to Tara about this if you have not been prompted on this.

CDL Listservs The CDL listservs are used to communicate about events, resources, and opportunities, either within the lab (CDL-INTERNAL), or with the lab and our close collaborators (CDL-EXTERNAL). See below for more details pertaining to our two listservs. Access the UBC Mailing Lists dashboard here. Once on the lists dashboard, copy and paste CDL-INTERNAL or CDL-EXTERNAL into the “Access unlisted lists” search bar. This will take you to the page for this mailing list. In the top right corner there will be a button (three lines) which contains a dropdown menu. Select “Subscribe or Unsubscribe” and you will be brought to the subscription page. Enter your name and preferred email address, choose ‘regular subscription’, and then hit subscribe. You will then need to click the link sent to your preferred inbox to confirm your subscription (Gmail users be sure to check your spam/junk). There is an option to log in with your CWL if you want to register with your UBC email, however some folks have had issues when they have done this so it is recommended you first try subscribing without logging in. If you prefer, or run into issues, you can email Madeline (madelinewoodley22@gmail.com) and ask to be added. Please identify your preferred email and which list(s) you would like to be added to. 1. CDL-INTERNAL The CDL-INTERNAL listserv (CDL-INTERNAL@lists.ubc.ca) is used to communicate internally, within the Conservation Decisions Lab. This includes anything from scheduling, to sharing resources, to asking questions of the group. 2. CDL-EXTERNAL The CDL-EXTERNAL listserv (CDL-EXTERNAL@lists.ubc.ca) is used to communicate with the lab and our collaborators. This generally includes communications about lab meetings and open events, as well as sharing resources and opportunities with our broader network. Slack Slack is a tool used for team communication. It is used for conversation that would otherwise clog our inboxes, such as quick project-related questions, lab events (e.g., after work drinks), other events of interest (e.g., seminars, presentations etc.), weekly updates, and general chit-chat. Documents and calendar invites can be shared in message threads called ‘channels’, with the option to also send private one-on-one messages. Be aware that all lab members do not use Slack equally, so important communications should still be sent via email. Your admittance to the CDL Slack channel will be granted upon request by either the lab manager or another lab member. You will be required to create a Slack account.

In addition, if you have a new publication or your work has been featured in the media, please share this with Tara so she can put it on the website and Instagram Instagram The CDL Instagram is currently run by Tara and is used as a more frequently updated public-facing platform. Lab members are encouraged to share any photos or videos of their work with Tara, with a caption for context, to be shared on the lab Instagram (or upload to the 01_CDL Social Media folder in Dropbox and notify Madeline). Riley has also been creating reels so connect with him if you have video footage of your work! Snapshot of CDL Instagram Logo Our beautiful CDL logo was created for us by Coast Salish artist, Sarah Jim. Please see the 02_Lab_Logo folder in the CDL Dropbox to access logo PNGs. There are many versions of the logo, varying in colour, detail, and text. Text was added by Emily Clark, PhD student and resident scientific illustrator. Lab members are encouraged to use our lab logo on research outputs (e.g., posters, presentations, reports, etc.) and select the version that best suits the output type. Please reference the logo contract for permissable uses. Lab Media The CDL Photo &amp; Media Archive is hosted in Dropbox. Due to its large file size, the media archive is currently hosted as an independent folder which lab members can choose to add locally to their Dropbox—or not—depending on their Dropbox storage space. For those who do not want to add this folder to their own Dropbox, the media folder can be accessed by clicking on the web shortcut in the 11_Media Folder in the CDL Dropbox. Media Guidelines Terms of Use for Media Partners The following terms of use apply to all images, media, and content shared with the Conservation Decisions Lab, as agreed upon with the photographers or media partners. Each project partner must review and approve the terms of use that best fit their needs before sharing any content. The following options are based on Creative Commons licensing, each has varying levels of permissions and protections. General Guidelines for Lab &amp; Media Partners: A Checklist ● Attribution: Always ensure proper credit is given to the photographer or media partner as specified in the agreed-upon terms of use. The exact wording of the credit should be agreed upon beforehand (e.g., photographer’s name, project name, or other relevant identifiers). When publishing or distributing the media, ensure the attribution is clearly legible—whether in print, online, or in presentations. ● Respecting Licensing: The Lab should always include a copy of the agreed-upon license when sharing media with external partners, collaborators, or media outlets to ensure the terms are respected. This minimizes any confusion or misuse of the media and ensures that all parties are aware of the legal boundaries for usage. For example, if an image is licensed for non- commercial use only (i.e to promote research) that condition must be communicated clearly to any third party. ● Consent for Additional Use: For any use of the media outside the scope of the original agreement (particularly commercial uses, such as being sold to a third-party media outlet), explicit written consent must be obtained from the photographer or media partner. This includes reselling the work, licensing it for new purposes, or sharing it with organizations not initially covered in the agreement. Always ensure that photographers are fully aware and compensated (if applicable) for any commercial uses. Types of Licensing Agreements 1. Attribution (CC BY 4.0) This license allows for the broadest use of media, permitting others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given to the original photographer. Terms: You must credit the original photographer as specified by them. You may not imply that the photographer endorses your use. Media may be used for both Lab-related and non-Lab-related stories, provided the above conditions are met. 2. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) This license permits others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work, but only for non- commercial purposes. Any derivative works must also acknowledge the original photographer. Terms: Media may only be used for non-commercial purposes (i.e., no resale or monetization). You must credit the original photographer in any public or digital use. Any alterations to the work must also provide credit to the original creator. Media shared by the Lab may not be used in third-party commercial media outlets without additional consent. 3. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) This license allows others to download and share the work as-is, but they cannot make any changes or use it commercially. Terms: Media must remain unchanged and cannot be adapted or altered. Use is restricted to non-commercial purposes only. Proper attribution is required when the media is shared or published. The Lab may distribute the media for educational or Lab-related content only. Any third-party use must receive explicit consent from the photographer. 4. Custom Commercial Agreement For media used in commercial outlets (such as major news organizations or publications), the Lab may negotiate specific terms with the photographer that go beyond standard Creative Commons licenses. Terms: Any media shared for commercial use must receive the photographer’s written consent and terms. A fee may be required for commercial use or resale of the work. Proper credit must be provided, and the terms of the commercial agreement should be adhered to strictly. 5. Lab-Specific Use Only (Custom License) In this scenario, the photographer grants the Lab the right to use their media exclusively for internal and educational purposes or in Lab-related content. This is not a Creative Commons license but a tailored agreement. Terms: Media can only be used for Lab-related publications, presentations, and projects. Media cannot be shared with external media outlets or used commercially. The photographer retains full copyright and control over the distribution of their work beyond the Lab. Social Media When sharing images or media on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or similar outlets, it’s important to acknowledge the unique challenges of crediting and maintaining control over the distribution of content. Given the ease of reposting or resharing on these platforms, the following guidelines can help ensure that proper credit is consistently maintained. 1. Embedding Credits in the Image: One of the most effective ways to ensure credit is retained when content is reshared is by embedding the photographer’s or creator’s name directly into the image or video. This can be done subtly but visibly—such as in a corner of the photo or within the frame of a video. The credit should be legible without distracting from the image itself. Example: A watermark in the bottom right corner that reads: “Photo by [Photographer’s Name]” or “[Photographer’s Handle].” 2. Including Credits in Captions: When posting on Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms, always include the proper credits in the caption. Tag the photographer or creator’s social media handle (if applicable) and add a clear mention of their contribution. Example Caption: “Captured by the amazing @PhotographerHandle to highlight critical Marsh Biodiversity #PhotoCredit #ArtistName” 3. Respecting Platform Limitations: Some social media platforms (like Instagram Stories) have shorter lifespans for posts, making embedded or visible credits essential. Whenever you are posting temporary media (e.g., Stories or Reels), ensure the photographer or creator is credited in the overlay text or in any supplementary captioning that appears with the media. 4. Permissions for Social Media Use: If the photographer or creator has not explicitly agreed to social media distribution, make sure you get their permission before posting. Social media may be considered a separate usage category, especially if there is potential for commercial gain through resharing or promotion. 5. Responding to Reposts Without Credit: In cases where an image or media piece is reshared without credit, kindly request that the person or outlet that reshared the content either adds the proper attribution or takes the post down if credit cannot be given. Example Message: “Thank you for sharing this image! Please make sure to credit the original photographer, [Photographer’s Name/Handle], as it’s part of our terms of use.” By embedding credits directly into images or videos and consistently using clear captions, we can better ensure that photographers and creators are credited properly, even as their work circulates across various social media platforms. "],["shareddigital.html", "Shared Digital Workspaces Github Dropbox Google Drive Shared Network Drive Lab Workstation", " Shared Digital Workspaces Github The CDL Github hosts the Conservation Decisions Lab Handbook, which should be treated as your primary point of reference during your time with the lab. The lab manual provides a comprehensive overview of lab processes and information pertaining to your progression through your degree and time with the lab. This handbook is a living document and is hosted on Github so that it can be continuously updated by lab members as information needs to be changed or added. Instructions for adding to the handbook directly can be found in the last section of the handbook (see here), or you can write/rewrite a section and email your changes to one of the research techs who will then make the necessary changes on Github. For those who have not yet been introduced to GitHub, it is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software. The CDL GitHub repository can also be used by lab members as one would normally use Github for project organization such as storing code, et cetera. Dropbox The Conservation Decisions Lab Dropbox is currently used for storing lab documents (e.g., copies of publications, document templates, et cetera) and employs web shortcuts, when relevant, to direct lab members to documents hosted in other shared digital workspaces (e.g., CDL Google Drive). The CDL Dropbox also contains a link to the CDL Photo &amp; Media Archive which can be added as an independent folder if storage space allows or accessed as a web shortcut from the main lab Dropbox here (see the Lab Media section for more information). If you do not have access to the lab Dropbox, please talk to Madeline. Also, if you need a paid subscription to Dropox to have more storage space, talk to Tara or Madeline. Google Drive Our shared CDL Google Drive is used to host shared documents that need to be edited collaboratively. This includes lab meeting schedule &amp; notes, contact lists, JEDI materials, event planning (e.g., conferences, lab events), and lists of publications/conferences/presentations. Documents stored here can also be accessed from web shortcuts in the CDL Dropbox to help make searching for information more intuitive and streamlined. If you do not have access to the lab Google Drive, please talk to Madeline. Shared Network Drive The shared network drive can be used to store large spatial and media files in a central, secure location. It is a useful way to back up files to the UBC server, and to allow large files to be shared with others in the lab instead of emailing them. You can encrypt files on the drive to maintain data security. The lab pays for storage (cost increases with quantity stored so please discuss with Tara if planning to use for large amounts of data). The shared network drive for the lab is called T Martin lab network drive, and is stored on the UBC server. It is available to lab members that have a UBC email address and CWL, and can be accessed off-campus via the VPN. Access to this shared drive is managed by Norm Hodges who will require your CWL to ensure your access to the workspace. This drive is capped at 20GB. Instructions on how to map the network drive can be found here. In step 2 of the instructions, login with the domain ‘ead’ and your CWL ID (e.g., ead). You may need to be on ubcsecure wifi network rather than eduroam to connect to the drive. You can also connect from off campus if you’re on the UBC VPN. If you are having trouble connecting, contact Riley (riley.finn@ubc.ca) or Madeline (madelinewoodley22@gmail.com) to ensure that you were given access. If this does not solve the issues contact Norm Hodges to help trouble shoot. The shared network drive is being considered as a potential platform for data archiving, though this is a work in progress. Please discuss with Tara when preparing to finish your time in the lab to determine whether storing your data here is appropriate. Lab Workstation The lab workstation, or remote desktop, is a computer that is available for the lab to use when a task requires more power/RAM than is available with our laptops or personal computers. The computer itself sits in the lab room 3202, but can be connected to from anywhere you have access to the UBC VPN. Please store any files that you need on the shared drive or the H drive rather than on the 3202a workstation/C drive as this system is reserved for running software that demands lots of memory and RAM. No one user should be taking up more than 10GB. Space usage is monitored. Scheduling time is done through the workstation-booking channel on Slack. You will be admitted to the CDL Slack channel upon request by the lab manager. When using the remote workstation please be sure to monitor the slack channel as some lab members leave software running over night. Remote Desktop Connection Connect to the UBC VPN guide on how to connect found here). The application ‘Remote Desktop Connection’ will connect you to the workstation. Access this by searching it in the Start Menu. Enter the link frst-fcs-3202a.ead.ubc.ca and your UBC credentials (ensure the domain is EAD). Once you have logged in for the first time you can create a shortcut to bypass the above steps. With the Remote Desktop Connection window open, click ‘show options’ and then save as to add the shortcut to your desktop or another location. Useful Settings Settings are available in the Remote Desktop Connection window under ‘show options’. By default, when you connect to the workstation it will open up on only one of your screens (assuming you have multiple screens). To expand the workstation across your whole computer, tick ‘use all my monitors’ under the display tab. If the connection bar at the top of the screen gets in your way, you can hide it by unticking the box at the bottom of the display tab. To bring the connection bar back temporarily, use ctrl+alt+home. You can also move and shorten the connection bar. To link your local drives and folders to the workstation, go to the local resources tab, then ‘more’, and tick ‘drives’. This will mean that all your folders from your regular computer will be available through the workstation (note that this step will not work on UBC-owned computers due to the way they are configured). To link the lab shared drive, map the drive as you did originally (see lab handbook for instructions). If you are doing a task that requires a lot of power and is causing things to lag, you can reduce the colour depth under the display tab to improve performance. Only one person can be logged onto the workstation and using applications at any one time. However, multiple people can also have things running in the background whilst being disconnected, and this can happen while someone else is logged in. For example, two lab members can have code running in R on the workstation while another lab member is logged in and using ArcGIS. Note that anything running in the background may slow down work that someone is doing whilst logged in, and vice versa. To access the task manager (for example, if an application is not responding and you need to end the task), use ctrl+alt+end. Note that ctrl+alt+del will bring up the task manager for your local computer. The default settings keep the clipboard activated, so you can copy and paste between the local computer and the workstation. Logging Out/Disconnecting DO NOT CLICK SHUT DOWN when using the workstation. Clicking shut down instead of disconnecting or logging out of the computer will turn the device off completely, meaning someone will have to go into the lab and physically turn it back on. This will not be damaging in any way, just an inconvenience, unless another user is running something in the background, then their work will be lost. Disconnecting from the workstation will take you back to your local computer, but the workstation will stay open in the background and whatever tasks you had running will continue. To disconnect, click the cross on the right of the connection bar at the top of the screen. Logging off is the same as for your local computer, i.e. unsaved work will be lost. Log off by clicking on your name under the Start Menu. Please log off whenever you have finished using the workstation.

When your preparation begins (as per discussions with Tara regarding your project) be sure to visit the following field work safety pages: Field Work Safety | Safety &amp; Risk Services Conducting Off-Campus Fieldwork | UBC Research + Innovation Travel and Field Safety l UBC A Fieldwork Safety Plan (FSP) is required for all fieldwork and must be submitted to your department for approval before you head out into the field. This approval process can take a few weeks hence it is best to begin thinking about the preparation of this document well in advance. You should receive an email from Pedro prompting you to complete this with the form attached, however you can also access the FSP document here in our lab Dropbox. Before submitting your plan for approval be sure to glace at the ‘Field Work Safety Plan – Completion checklist’. You can find this checklist here. Once Tara has signed off on your safety plan you are ready to submit your safety plan to Pedro Ribeiro (pedro.ribeiro@ubc.ca) for approval and archiving. Research Ethics If you are planning to conduct research involving animals, including fieldwork, you will need to undergo the CCAC Experimental Animal User Training Program before applying for research ethics approval. Similarly, if you will be conducting research involving humans, including surveys/questionnaires, interviews, or workshops, you will need to do the TCPS 2 Course on Research Ethics tutorial before applying for research ethics approval. RISe Portal Research Information Systems (RISe) is an online portal that allows researchers and administrators to manage and track applications online through to approval, certification and awarding of funds. One of the main uses for RISe is ethics application and approval. Information on completing a UBC Behavioral Research Ethics Board application can be found here. Equipment General Field Equipment The CDL field equipment inventory can be found here. This list is currently not up to date, so if you are wondering about what equipment is available please reach out to Aidan for the time being until the list is updated. If you require the use of any equipment please ensure that you alert Aidan prior to your fieldwork excursions to ensure that the equipment is up-to-date on repairs and servicing and is accessible to you (a great deal of our equipment is stored on Salt Spring Island). If you require equipment not currently owned by the lab, please connect with Tara to discuss payment options. Depending on the equipment and lab finances, Tara may be willing to purchase equipment that could contribute to the overall function of the lab. Otherwise, this will need to come from the students’ grant (e.g., Mitacs research &amp; material costs) Please note that all lab equipment will be inspected before an after use; please use this equipment with care and as if it was your own. Lab Truck The field truck is available for use by lab members for fieldwork (at a cost to cover gas/maintenance), please discuss with Tara if you think you may want to use it. It is a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with a lockable canopy. The designated parking stall in the parking lot below Forestry is #15 (shared with Dr. Cole Burton’s WildCo Lab) but the truck is often stored on Salt Spring Island and so arrangements to bring it to the mainland for work must be made in advance. There is a UBC fuel card that should be used to fill up the vehicle, and is kept in a plastic sleeve in the glovebox. The purchase will then be charged to the designated project fund by Madeline. When using the vehicle, please remember the following: Fill with fuel at end of use (a use may be multiple days) Use fuel card in glovebox to fill up and send photos of gas receipts to Madeline Keep record of vehicle use (i.e., trip details) and send this to Madeline Research Vessel The lab’s research vessel, Seablush, is a 6.26m outboard Silverstream with a 150 horsepower (HP) Yamaha engine and a 9.9 HP kicker engine. The vessel is moored on Salt Spring Island at a private marina in the Fulford Harbour. The vessel will only be operated by qualified operators, Dr. Tara Martin or Aidan Haigh. When budgeting the use of the research vessel for a project use the ratio of 1 nautical mile to 1.5$ of gas and maintenance. Marine engines should only be filled with mid-grade gasoline. Please take this information into consideration when budgeting for vessel use during project planning.

For students, in most cases this expense will come out of your own grant (e.g., a student might have a budget for “Material and Research Costs” within their Mitacs which can be used to pay for equipment costs). However, there may also be certain cases where the lab covers the expense. If you anticipate this situation, please discuss with Tara before incurring the expense and then inform Madeline of the agreement you and Tara have reached (email Madeline, CC Tara, and include the cost or an approximation). For staff, all work related expenses are covered by the lab. These include: Work-related travel expenses (ferry, airfare, vehicle mileage) Meals when travelling out of town for meetings, workshops Mileage to cover driving to field sites Equipment and computing software – as agreed with Tara Small Scale Suppliers If your project requires hiring and/or paying external contractors and you plan to file a reimbursement claim for this expense through UBC, please ensure that you contact Madeline about this as early as possible and most importantly before the contractor begins work. The process of setting up an external supplier or vendor takes about 6 weeks and requires paperwork involving all parties. Submitting a Reimbursement Claim Email Madeline Woodley (madelinewoodley22@gmail.com) with the expense amount and expense type (brief description). You can either include this directly in your email or fill out the second page of this form. Madeline will respond with the fund type (i.e., grant, gift, project, program) and worktag number to which you can charge your expense. If Madeline is unavailable, email Tara (tara.martin@ubc.ca) or Aidan Haigh (aidanhaigh@gmail.com). Go to the Expenses Hub in Workday and select “Create Expense Report”. Use the following articles to help you fill out the expense report. If you cannot access the articles via the hyperlinks included below, go to the Integrated Services Centre, follow the link to the Workday Knowledge Base and sign in with CWL if prompted. Once in the Workday Knowledge Base, select “Workday Finance”, and enter “Create Out of Pocket Expense Report”, “Create an Expense Report for Mileage”, or “Create an Expense Report for Student” (depending on which article you require) using the search bar. Follow the link that shows up to take you to the relevant article. Create an Out of Pocket Expense Report For all out of pocket reimbursements claimed by staff, faculty or student employees.

"],["datamgmt.html", "Data Management Principles and Best Practices Data Management Plans Lab Archive", " Data Management When planning and conducting research, it is good practice to also think about and develop a system for managing your data. Research data management generally refers to how researchers structure, organize, document, use, preserve, and share data throughout the research life cycle. Good data management can help reduce errors, minimize confusion, and improve the quality of your data and the efficiency of your analysis. Data that is well-organized and documented will also be easier to share and archive for future use, allowing others to understand and make use of your data and/or reproduce your research. Principles and Best Practices How to best organize and manage your data will depend on the type of data and analysis, as well as your (and your collaborators’) preferences. Here are some brief guides and primers on best practices in data management, to help you get started: Good Enough Research Data Management–A Very Brief Guide British Ecological Society (BES) guides to Data Management and Reproducible Code Directory structure and File naming guidelines Spreadsheet best practices from the University of Pennsylvania and UC Davis Kristin Briney’s blog post about README files and UBC’s Creating a README for your dataset Codebooks &amp; Data Dictionaries and template How to make a data dictionary For more information about the principles of Research Data Management, check out the following resources: Online text on Research Data Management in the Canadian Context UBC Library Research Data Management guide and other online resources Tri-Agency Statement of Principles on Digital Data Management Data Management Plans Generally, data management plans provide information on: how data will be collected, documented, formatted, protected and preserved; how existing datasets will be used and what new data will be created over the course of the research project; whether and how data will be shared; and where data will be deposited. Creating a data management plan is particularly useful when working collaboratively with others on a project and sharing or preserving data for future use. Data management plans are also important components of research ethics applications. In some cases, a formal Data Management Plan document may be required for some grant applications, including from NSERC or SSHRC. See the following for additional resources and tools to help you develop a data management plan: Guide from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Creating a Data Management Plan Document guide from the Center for Open Science NCEAS Learning Hub’s coreR Course chapter on data management plans DMP Assistant online tool for developing data management plans that meet the requirements for Canada’s federal research funding agency grants. See the UBC Library Research Data Management website to learn more. Digital Research Alliance of Canada training resources. Lab Archive Please note that the following section is a work in progress as we are working through a plan for data archiving - updates will be reflected here, but please connect with Tara when needing to archive data Once your research has been completed, you are expected to leave an archive of your data and analysis code with the lab, along with any additional documentation needed for others to understand how your data was collected, processed, and analyzed, and how the data should be managed, shared, and/or used in the future. Recommended Content When archiving, we strongly recommend following best practices in data management and reproducible code, and ask that you include: a copy of the raw (unprocessed) data files, if possible. In many cases, this may consist simply of data collected from field sampling or compiled from expert elicitations or systematic literature reviews where applicable, the source of the data - e.g., image or video files from camera traps or bioacoustic monitoring devices, audio/video recordings of interviews/workshops, copies of survey responses, spatial data files, etc. If (physical) field samples were collected and stored in the lab for future analyses, include an inventory list of the samples, where and when they were collected, and where and how they are stored. the code used to process and analyze the data and generate any figures. If data cleaning/formatting was done manually (i.e., not using R or other programming software), then a detailed description of how input files for the analysis were derived from the raw data files should also be included a data dictionary/codebook that defines the variables and describes the structure, content, and layout of the dataset. Include the names of individuals that collected the data and the date and location of data collection if these were not already included in the dataset or the in the report/manuscript (see next item), a copy of the final report, thesis or thesis chapter, or scientific manuscript that describes the data collection methods, equipment and materials used, and the analysis. - any additional documentation needed to allow for replication of the study if needed permits or approvals needed for experimental or field data collection, or for any research involving humans (e.g., expert elicitations, interviews, workshops) data use/ownership agreements (if applicable), copyright licenses (e.g., Creative Commons), and protocols that govern how the data should be used, managed, stored, or shared in the future. In addition, we also encourage you to archive copies of field/workshop photos or videos, presentations about the project, and copies of (or links to) any media articles that featured the study. Documents related to project administration, such as grant applications/agreements and contracts, budgets, progress reports, invoices, contact lists, et cetera should also be included in the archive in a separate ‘admin’ subfolder. Make sure to include read me files that describe the contents of each subfolder or group of subfolders. Consult the links provided above as well as this guide from Cornell University to learn more about read me files.

Eat well, exercise, go to sleep, stop drinking caffeine, check in with family &amp; friends, and visit your doctors and/or therapists. Coffee ≠ Sleep Learn to say no! Do not overcommit yourself and check in with your capacity levels often. Graduate school is a marathon not a sprint, and it is important to set regular work times and external deadlines to manage your time well so you do not burn out. Don’t reinvent the wheel! Check out reference documents from other graduate students in the lab, including archived proposals, comprehensive slides, and dissertations for examples. We recommend timing your comprehensive exam as early as you can, closer to the finalization of your proposal, at the end of your first or second year. Check out the UBC graduate game plan for some student To Do’s throughout various steps of your graduate program. Change up where you work! There are lots of fun places across campus if you want to change up your work space. Good library spots include the 3rd floor of the Law Library, Woodward Library, the Asian Studies Library, or any Library in the summer when undergraduates are gone. For coffee shops, the Beanery, Loafe, and Great Dane are fantastic locations. Also don’t wait in line for the Tim Hortons in Forestry–download the app or go elsewhere!

On campus, the MoA, Beaty, Belkin, &amp; Botanical Gardens are all free, and other places around Vancouver include discounted student pricing including the Vandusen Botanical Garden and most museums. Go to cool Vancouver Festivals! There are really cool festivals occurring around Vancouver throughout the year you should take advantage of (aka work-life balance)! There is the Cherry Blossom Festival in the Spring, Bard on the Beach all summer long, Fringe Festival in early September, Vancouver International Film Festival in late September &amp; early October, the Vancouver Writers Festival at the end of October, and the Christmas Markets in November and December. Seek out workshops &amp; seminars! Take advantage of free or cheap workshops &amp; seminars for improving skill sets, often through Forestry, Beaty, and UBC Libraries. Subscribe to listservs for info on events (BRC is a good one) &amp; actually read Forestry grad weekly every week! Remember you can Audit classes! Take advantage of Free Week! Free Week—which is held at the beginning of each semester—provides students with the opportunity to try out the various fitness classes offered by UBC Recreation. These include dance, martial arts, yoga and pilates, spin, and other forms of group fitness classes (e.g., boot camps, cardio, strength, etc.). After Free Week, spin, yoga, pilates, boot camps, and other group fitness classes can be accessed on a drop-in basis through a Fitness Class membership ($95/semester for students). Dance and martial arts classes typically require registration on a semester basis. These more consistent classes can be a great way to not only build a routine but also meet new people. Find healthy and cheap food options! On campus, there are some hidden gems for cheap, healthy food options, including two student and volunteer-run cafes known as Agora Café (found in the basement of 2357 Main Mall (H.R.

You can think of it like manually asking Dropbox for the latest version of a document that was edited by a collaborator, but rather than one specific document, GitHub tracks changes across the entire repository. In GitHub Desktop you can sync your files by clicking on Fetch origin (Figure 3). Figure 3: Fetch origin should always be the place to start to make sure you are working with the latest version of the handbook. 3.2 Edit the Files Editing the manual requires some basic understanding of R Studio, Markdown, and Bookdown. These tools allow us to build the web document. The file structure and names are important for functionality of the book. The key elements are highlighted and explained in Figure 4. Each Chapter is its own Markdown (.rmd) file, its number determines its place in the book. The index file acts as the welcome page and defines the formatting of the book. Larger edits to the structure of the book can be done through a re-numbering of the contributing files. Edits to the content of the Chapters themselves can be done by opening the R Project File ‘CDL-lab-handbook’. This will launch RStudio where the individual chapters can be opened and edited. Figure 4: File structure for the lab handbook. R Studio and Markdown The content of the handbook is written in Markdown using RStudio (Figure 5). Markdown is a simple language for editing text. It provides simple conventions for defining headers, incorporating links, inline code, images and more. Markdown relies on a system of symbols to indicate the formatting, rather than applying the formatting and editing the content at the same time like in Word. The formatting is then complied into HTML for visualization at the end. For the purposes of the Lab Handbook we really only need to understand the basics like headers, lists, and images. A helpful guide for the basics of writing in Markdown can be found here. It can also be useful to look at how the existing chapters look in R and see how this translates to the version of the Handbook that is currently online. Figure 5: Editing the content of the Handbook within RStudio. Bookdown Bookdown is the R package that is used to compile all the chapters and format the webpage. When editing for the first time you will have to download this package you can do this through the ‘Packages Tab’ in RStudio or running the command ‘install.packages(“bookdown”)’ in the console (Figure 6). Figure 6: How to install the Bookdown package (only required the first time). With Bookdown installed the final step of adding the changes to the Lab Manual after saving the edits to the .rmd is to recompile the book. You can do this by clicking on ‘Build’ in the top right pane, and then clicking ‘Build Book’ (Figure 7). This takes the changes that have been applied to the Markdown files and generates new HTML files that can be viewed online. Once the book has been built it will open in a pop-up screen and you can check to make sure everything looks right. Figure 7: Building the book compiles the changes made to the individual .rmd files and generates html documents that can be visualized online. 3.3 Push Edits to the Main Branch After making edits and compiling the book, GitHub desktop should show which files have been changed and what those changes are. In Figure 8, you can see that the paragraph that was edited has been highlighted and duplicated in red and green. The red version shows the previous text and the green version shows what it has been changed to. You can see I’ve changed the wording from ‘critical’ to ‘essential’ and that is highlighted within those paragraphs. You will also notice that all the files in the ‘docs/’ folder have been updated. This is due to the Bookdown compilation creating a new version of each file. The actual edits made will only be reflected in the corresponding html document for Chapter 2. Figure 8: Example of changes recorded in GitHub Desktop. The final step before committing and pushing our changes to the remote repository is to write a short comment about the changes that were made (Figure 9). This will help keep track of what was changed and when. Figure 9: Example comment to contextualize the changes that have been made. After noting the changes I’ve made, I can commit the change to the repository by clicking ‘Commit to main’. With the change committed you can now ‘push’ that change to the Remote Repository by clicking ‘Push origin’ (Figure 10). Now others will be able to see the changes that have been made. Figure 10: Push the change to the remote repository. You can create multiple commits before pushing them all at once if you have multiple discrete editing tasks that you would like to accomplish. 4. Collaboration and Conflicts Just like Dropbox can produce conflicted copies when two people are editing the same document, conflicts can occur in Git. To be honest, I’ve never used GitHub collaboratively so I don’t have the best handle on how this works. As long as two people don’t make different edits to the same section of text, GitHub should be able to integrate edits made to different components of the book. There shouldn’t be to many problems with simultaneous editing as, but it will be a learning experience for all of us and we can add what we learn to this section. A Comparative Example with Dropbox Below is a table that outlines the steps of collaborating on a document through GitHub and compares them to the functionality of Dropbox. Hopefully this example will help elucidate the general workflow of GitHub, and how the steps provide control over each step of making edits.
