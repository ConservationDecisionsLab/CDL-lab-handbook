# Conference Information {-#conferences}

Students are encouraged to attend at least one conference during a Master's degree and two during a PhD. Please discuss expectations and opportunities with Tara early in your degree and continue to check in as you progress through your time in the lab. Students are encouraged to apply for conference funding opportunities (*stay tuned for section on this*) and to register early for discounted fees.
