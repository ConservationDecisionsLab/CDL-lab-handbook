# Onboarding {-#orientation}

## Onboarding Reference Materials {-#onboardingreferences}

Graduate students should review the [Graduate Student Portal](https://forestry.ubc.ca/students/graduate-student-portal/) and the [Graduate Student Handbook](https://forestry.ubc.ca/files/2023/09/Forestry-Gradbook.pdf) created by UBC Forestry. Staff should review the [UBC onboarding checklist](https://hr.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/New_Hire_Onboarding_Checklist.pdf).

## Setting up CWL and FASmail {-#CWLFasmail}

Students will have created a CWL account when applying to UBC, but should ensure their student email accounts are working, if they wish to use them. Contact Forestry IT (<forestry.ithelp@ubc.ca> or using the [UBC Self Service Portal](https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=1736823d939686105a9f30edfaba1089)) if you encounter problems or have questions.

Staff who are new to UBC will need to create a CWL account; you will receive an email from UBC IT with instructions to create this account once your employment agreement has been signed. For staff who have previously been employed by UBC, your old CWL account will be reactivated once you employment agreement has been signed. In both cases, you will also receive an email from IT regarding your FASmail account (staff email account, hosted by Outlook) which you can access [here](https://outlook.office.com/mail/) by logging in with your CWL credentials.

## UBC Card & Building Access {-#access}

Both staff and students will need to apply for a UBC card if they do not already have one.

Students can apply for a UBC student card [here](https://ubccard.ubc.ca/obtaining-a-ubccard/students). Note that UBC now offers students both digital and physical cards. Staff can apply for a UBC staff card [here](https://ubccard.ubc.ca/obtaining-a-ubccard/faculty-staff).

Once you have obtained your card, you will need to contact Natasha Thompson (<natasha.thompson@ubc.ca>) to get the necessary building access (you will at least need access to the FSC building, lab room in FSC 3202, 3rd floor kitchen, and 3rd floor printing room). Tara will need to approve your access so either CC her in your email to Natasha or have Tara email Natasha directly.

If appropriate to your role, staff should also talk to Tara about being added to her faculty account with the UBC Bookstore (can be used to restock lab supplies at a discount).

Generally, the Forest Sciences Center (FSC) requires card access after 5pm and on weekends. See [After Hours Access](#afterhoursaccess) for more information.

## Workday {-#workday}

Since 2024, [Workday](https://hr.ubc.ca/working-ubc/welcome-workday) has become the primary platform for UBC processes. This is where you will register for courses, complete necessary workplace training, and submit reimbursement claims, among other things.

### Workday Onboarding & Training {-#workdaytraining}

At the start of your appointment, you will receive emails from Workday prompting you to complete the necessary onboarding tasks and workplace training modules.

### Benefit Elections (Staff) {-#staffbenefits}

For staff, it is important that at the start of your appointment you enroll in benefits and complete your benefit elections. Workday, and Natasha, will prompt you to do so, but you should still be aware that this is a necessary step and must be completed early on in your appointment. To review what benefits you are eligible for, visit the [UBC HR website](https://hr.ubc.ca/benefits) and explore the [plan associated with your employment group](https://hr.ubc.ca/benefits/eligibility-enrolment/employee-groups).

Also, you should familiarize yourself with [UBC Perks for Faculty & Staff](https://hr.ubc.ca/health-and-wellbeing/physical-wellbeing/ubc-perks-faculty-and-staff).

## FSC Building Orientation {-#buildingorientation}

If based in Vancouver, you will spend a great deal of your time in the [Forest Sciences Centre](https://www.google.com/maps/place/UBC+Faculty+of+Forestry/@49.2608897,-123.2505023,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x548672cbc1b06175:0xcf03ffb2c3a1dafb!8m2!3d49.2604859!4d-123.2488265!16s%2Fg%2F11bw_6ls11?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). This is the home of UBC's Faculty of Forestry and houses our lab room (FSC 3202), Tara's office (FSC 4607), Forestry grad student offices, study spaces, lecture theatres, and more. The Conservation Decisions Lab belongs to the Forest & Conservation Sciences (FCS) department and primarily occupy the 3rd floor.

Natasha Thompson (<natasha.thompson@ubc.ca>) also offers incoming staff/student/faculty tours of the Forestry building if desired. You can also ask Madeline for a tour of the building if you've not already been offered one.

### Lab Room (FSC 3202) {-#labroom}

The lab room (FSC 3202) is a shared workplace and all lab members should feel welcome to use the space, with the understanding that our research techs (Riley, Aidan & Madeline) use this room as their shared office. Please be respectful of this by being quiet if folks are working and/or in meetings, cleaning up after yourself, and helping replenish supplies you use often (honour system).

The lab room has a kitchen space with various appliances, including a fridge, kettle, microwave, panini press, drip coffee machine, and espresso machine. Generally, the room is also stocked with milk, coffee (caffeinated & decaf), tea, honey, and chocolate. All lab members are welcome and encouraged to use these supplies, but please contribute by keeping things clean and restocked!

In terms of work-related supplies/equipment, the lab room is equipped with a white-board and projector, and currently houses a colour printer which can be useful for after-hours printing (and prints on write-in-the-rain paper). The lab room also hosts the lab computer which can be helpful when running large datasets and can be accessed remotely. This is available to all lab members, just make sure it is not in use before accessing it. For more information, ask Riley (<riley.finn@ubc.ca>). There are also a host of office supplies and tech accessories in the lab room – cupboards & drawers are labelled, and you can ask the research techs if you require something specific.

Finally, the lab room houses our lab library (shelves on the wall above Madeline & Aidan’s workspaces). Folks are welcome to borrow from this library and use the sign-out sheet on the fridge when you borrow/return a book.

### Tara's Office (FSC 4607) {-#taraoffice}

Tara's office is located on the fourth floor (FSC 4607). This is where you will go to have your 1-on-1 meeting, unless Tara is joining via Zoom.

### Student Offices {-#studentoffices}

If you are not automatically set up with an office space, talk to Natasha Thompson (<natasha.thompson@ubc.ca>).

### Common Spaces {-#commonspaces}

**Forestry Graduate Student Lounge (FSC 1715)**

**Forestry Staff Lounge (FSC 4003)**

**Kitchen & Mail Room (FSC 3039)**

**Printing/Copying Room (FSC 3005)**

### After Hours Access {-#afterhoursaccess}



## Work Supplies {-#worksupplies}

### Technology {-#techsupplies}

Ensure you have the necessary work materials/equipment (email Madeline/Tara if you require a work computer, monitor, or other work equipment). Norman Hodges (<norman.hodges@ubc.ca>) keeps an up-to-date record of available laptops & tech accessories for our lab.

### Software {-#softwaresupplies}

Download necessary softwares from the [UBC On the Hub](https://ubc.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) website. Talk to Tara & Madeline if you require a software that is not offered for free through UBC and requires payment.

## Academic Calendar {-#academiccalendar}
