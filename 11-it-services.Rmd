# IT Services {-#itservices}

[IT services website](https://it.ubc.ca/) will provide you with countless pieces of vital information about how UBC’s IT system functions.

Norman Hodges ([norman.hodges@ubc.ca](mailto:norman.hodges@ubc.ca)) is the IT Technician for Forestry. When first arriving in the Department, some things that Norm may be able to help with are found below, however please do ensure that you first visit the IT services website and or [submit a service ticket](https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice) if necessary before contacting Norm directly. Please remember that you may contact the CDLab manager who will be willing and able to direct you to the best resources for the most efficient assistance. 

* Ordering computer hardware
* Installing software (eg. ArcGIS, R, Mendeley)
* Setting up a connection to the wifi and VPN
* Mapping the shared network drive 
* Adding devices such as printers

Do note that if you are using a UBC owned and operated laptop you will be unable to install software without Norm accessing your desktop remotely and providing admin access to install software.  

Also note that UBC has strict rules (often under BC law) concerning some types of applications and software, and as such you can expect restricted access to some software.
