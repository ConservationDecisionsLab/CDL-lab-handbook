### 1. Download GitHub Desktop

I use the desktop version of GitHub. I find it is the most intuitive way to work with the program and the website. There is an installation tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

### 2. Clone the Handbook Repository

The first time you download a repository from a remote location you are creating a clone (Figure 1). This is the local version of the repository that lives on your computer. It is analogous to adding a shared folder in Dropbox.
