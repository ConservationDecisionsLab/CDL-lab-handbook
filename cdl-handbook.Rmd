# Equity Diversity and Inclusion Policy {#diversity .unnumbered}

To begin we would like to introduce [our equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) policy](https://www.taramartin.org/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/). The Martin Conservation Decisions Lab (CDL) and the Arcese Lab at the University of British Columbia---led by Dr. Tara Martin and Dr. Peter Arcese, respectively---have worked together to develop this Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Statement. We recognize the colonial contexts of conservation and academia, both past and present, and the systemic inequities that prevail. We see it as our responsibility to encourage, include, and make way for underrepresented and marginalized voices and perspectives, meaningfully collaborate with and support the work of Indigenous communities, and to communicate our research to a broad cross-section of society across all demographics. We strive to decolonize the science that we do from the questions we pose, to the manner in which we undertake and communicate the science.

Our labs are committed to recruiting and collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity is critical for transforming us into better students, teachers, scientists, conservation practitioners, and members of our communities. The challenges we face in conservation and as a society at large---whether they be related to biodiversity, climate change, and/or EDI---require a shared understanding, novel perspectives, and transformative actions. We are actively working to reduce barriers to diverse representation in our research, in conservation, and in academia. Through this process, we aim to share knowledge, experience, and insight with each other that can be applied to our future workplaces, many of which share similar legacies of systemic inequality.

We acknowledge that our labs---centred at UBC Vancouver---are located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish people.[The land where UBC is situated has always been a place of learning where people for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.](https://indigenous.ubc.ca/indigenous-engagement/musqueam-and-ubc/) Members of our lab engage in research on this land, as well as in the territories of other First Nations in BC and Indigenous communities across Canada and the world. We have a duty to reflect and reconcile the nature of our work with the history and ongoing nature of colonialism, academic research, and Indigenous dispossession. It is our intent to foster meaningful relationships with the communities whose lands we are working on and engage in a research process that is beneficial to and is anchored by the values, goals, and interests of those communities.

We acknowledge that each of us may be at different points throughout our journey in learning, listening, and cultivating an inclusive academic environment and that mistakes can be made. We also understand how important it is to learn from those mistakes and to not let the fear of making a mistake be an excuse for inaction. To guide our journey, we are committed to continuously revisiting these values and updating this EDI statement as a living document.

We welcome feedback and inquiries concerning this statement. If you are a prospective student or collaborator and would like to know more about our lab policies, please reach out to the CDLab manager with any comments, or to discuss any aspect of EDI related to our labs.

## Our Values {-#values}

We value diversity of identities, knowledge systems, and worldviews in our lab and community.

We value a lab culture whereby we can reflect on our personal and collective identities, both as researchers and as colleagues. This means we are actively acknowledging the intersecting privilege and/or barriers that we may or may not face associated with our identities.

We value acceptance. Discrimination—e.g., unjust treatment on the basis of sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, national origin, education level, physical and mental ability, age, physical appearance, political views—in any form will not be tolerated within this space. Derogatory or hurtful comments will not be accepted and all lab members are encouraged to initiate discussion when inappropriate behavior or language is observed.

We value accountability in supporting and nurturing a culture of safety within our team. All members of our team commit to creating a safe, supportive, respectful, and inviting community.

We value an ongoing and iterative journey of learning. We recognize the continuous commitment of (un)learning necessary to build a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive community.

## Actions {-#ediactions}

  *	Examining reward systems within and beyond academia (e.g., what constitutes “good” research questions, reward systems for research participants)
  *	Equitable hiring relative to opportunities (e.g., consider paid positions vs volunteers, make space early and often for conversations around additional resources and capacity for hiring graduate students and PDFs)

*	Decolonizing our approach to research
  *	E.g., Fostering collaborative approaches to co-developing research, practicing accountability (e.g., “helicopter research”), and being open to timeframes and reward systems outside of academia
  *	Access training for appropriate ethics (e.g., UBC and Nation/community-specific intake processes), communication, and decolonizing 
  *	“Doing our homework” - knowing where we work and the historical context of the systems we get to work in
  *	Be open and curious to multiple ways of knowing, learning, and communicating

*	Daylighting health and wellness
  *	Prioritizing our own and each other’s mental health in grad school
  *	Openly discussing / holding space for health and wellness obstacles, personally and professionally (i.e., in academic spaces) 
  *	Celebrating success beyond the h-index and the awards list! 

## Resources {-#ediresources}

As a part of our EDI commitment we have established an [online resources center](https://docs.google.com/document/d/102fsqZL8UVf22TX1kTZ1WjQu2U9SrFjEBbQ9NipedXA/edit#heading=h.axugsem4agey) for EDI related materials. This is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. We encourage all lab members to add to this resource pool. Thank you in advance for contributing material that you believe will assist in our collective education.

# Lab Member Commitments

## Lab Meetings

All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every three weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually. When the lab meetings are hosted at UBC, it is expected that all lab members are to attend face-to-face in order ensure that all lab members have the opportunity to socialize with other members, however we understand that exceptions must be made due to circumstance. 

When meetings are scheduled while under a public health order or regulation these meetings will be held virtually via Zoom.

Lab meetings present an opportunity for lab members to showcase their current work or work that they have done in the past and practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defense. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. Each lab member is expected to lead a lab meeting twice a year. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WAL131F2qjLT-kYOPUGV7lpESvUIczRtx1Q2oqTfdRQ/edit#gid=740242269) along with historical lab meeting topics. 

The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab member by the CDLab manager who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting.

As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our EDI statement these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for EDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone else’s but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so.

## 1-on-1 Meetings

Mentees will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. The CDLab manager will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to the CDLab manager. 

<!--chapter:end:03-lab-member-commitments.Rmd-->

# New to Vancouver {-#newvancouver}

This is by no means an exhaustive list of tips and tricks for those who are new to the great city of Vancouver. Many of our lab members are from elsewhere in Canada and the world and so have gone through the process of moving and settling in Vancouver, and will be happy to give tips. We urge for you to communicate via our [slack](#slack), via email or in person with other lab members who live in Vancouver and who will be able to provide more information and suggestions on how to enjoy the city to it’s fullest extent. 

## Cultural Awareness {-#vancouverculture}

As stated in our lab’s EDI statement Dr. Tara Martin encourages and supports lab members to take time to become aware of the culture surrounding Vancouver and the areas where research is conducted and beyond. 

It is expected that each lab member begins to familiarize themselves with the lush cultural surroundings of Vancouver and the Point Grey Campus. You will notice that a land acknowledgment is common practice during introductions. UBC provides [a guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/distance-research-xwi7xwa/landacknowledgements) to assist those new to the land acknowledgment practice and we encourage all lab members to participate in this brief yet vital ‘Respect, Sincerity & Responsibility: Land Acknowledgements @ UBC’ course. Enroll [here](https://wpl.ubc.ca/browse/orientation-and-onboarding/courses/wpl-oo-ilpla).

For those incoming lab members that are new to Canada and Canadians alike, we highly recommend and encourage enrolling in the ‘[Indigenous Canada](https://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada)’ course offered by the University of Alberta and hosted by coursera which provides effective context to Canada’s history of colonization. This is a great course and is expected to take 21 hours to complete. 

We also greatly encourage new lab members to familiarize themselves with the [First Nations House of Learning](https://indigenous.ubc.ca/longhouse/fnhl/) at UBC which is an incredible resource and provides opportunity to learn about how you can actively work to decolonize your own world view. 

## Events {-#vancouverevents}

There are many [festivals and events throughout the year in Vancouver](https://www.destinationvancouver.com/events/calendar-of-events/). Some that are recommended by lab members are:
* Cherry Blossom Festival (April)
* Celebration of Light (July)
* Vancouver Folk Music Festival (July)
* Pride (BC Day weekend, August)
* Vancouver International Film Festival (September)
* Fringe Festival (September)
* Westward Music festival (September)
* Vancouver Christmas Market (November-December)

## Statutory Holidays {-$statutory}

Statutory holidays recognized as paid holidays by UBC can be found listed [here](https://hr.ubc.ca/working-ubc/statutory-holidays).

## Housing {-#housing}

There are 14 on-campus residences at UBC Vancouver. Visit [https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/) to find out more.

If you are planning a move to Vancouver some of the most effective resources are Facebook, Craigslist, and Used Vancouver. Some have also had success by walking the neighborhoods they are interested in looking for vacancy signs out the front of buildings. 

There are many Facebook groups that advertise rentals, sublets and housemates, including Vancouver Rentals and Roommates, For Rent Vancouver, Vancouver apartments/houses for rent/roommates, Vancouver Buy/Sell Fast and Aussies in Vancouver. We encourage the use of our [Slack](#slack) where new members may ask housing related questions of those how have also gone through the process of finding housing in Vancouver. 

It is worth knowing that in BC, lease periods begin on the 1st of the month and sometimes on the 15th. The term of lease agreement varies from month to month, three months, 6 months, and a year.

For those who are new to renting the [Housing and tenancy page of the BC government website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy) provides great resources on how to ensure that you legally protect yourselves as a tenant. It is highly recommended to ensure that your landlord provides you with a [lease agreement](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/starting-a-tenancy/tenancy-agreements) regardless of history or personal connections. 

<!--chapter:end:04-new-to-vancouver.Rmd-->

# New to UBC {#newtoubc .unnumbered}

Room 3101 has wall space for a projector, which can be borrowed from FCS Reception (try to book in advance). These rooms must be booked in advance through [Natasha Thompson](#contacts) at the FCS reception, and a key obtained from her at time of use.

## Common Spaces {-#commonspaces}

The kitchen on level 3 is room 3039. This is available to all staff, students and faculty, but is closed at 4:30 each day. There is a kitchen and dining area on level 4 (room 4003) that is for staff and faculty use only, unless it is booked for an event. 

Desks and lounge areas include the level 3 landing, and the Treehouse, which is the study space in the atrium with all the plants.

## Printing/Copying {-#printing}

Room 3005 is the copy room for FCS. The photocopy code assigned to Tara and the lab is 426520, which is charged to Tara’s start-up fund.

## UBC Social Events {-#ubcsocial}

### Seminars

There are regular seminars held during the school year by the Department and open to staff, students and faculty. These include the [Comparative Physiology seminar series](https://zoology.ubc.ca/events/weekly-seminars/friday-comparative-physiology-invited-speaker-seminar) and the FCS Wednesday seminar series. Notification of the FCS seminar is emailed to all staff, faculty and grad students. To be notified of other seminars and discussions, join email lists (see section 2.1.2).

### Biodiversity Beers

Biodiversity Beers is a social event held in the atrium of the Biodiversity Building every Friday at 5pm. All are welcome to attend, and also to [volunteer for the buying/serving of drinks ](https://blogs.ubc.ca/biodiversitysocial/volunteer-information/).

Notifications for the event come through the zoology [email list](#emaillists).

## Hazardous Waste 

Information about hazardous waste disposal at UBC can be found [here](https://srs.ubc.ca/environment/hazardous-waste-management/hazardous-waste-manual/).

Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are:
* Sharps (syringes, razors, blades)
* Animal blood
* Uncontaminated animal carcasses
* Non-indigenous species (includes soil and plants)

Disposal of biological waste may require special training. Contact Rolando Descalzo, Collections Manager, for waste disposal inquires ([rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca](mailto:rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca)).

<!--chapter:end:05-new-to-ubc.Rmd-->

# Getting to UBC {-#transportation}

## Bus

Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby Skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. 

The information about U-Pass BC/Compass card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found [here](https://planning.ubc.ca/transportation/transit/u-pass-compass-card). UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC. 

A Compass card is the most cost-effective way of using Skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass cards can be purchased at vending machines in Skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7eleven outlets. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass card to give unlimited access to Skytrain, Canada Line and SeaBus services. 

A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include Skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo). 

<insert map showing bus stops>

## Car

Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased [here](https://parking.ubc.ca/permits-rates). Designated parking stalls are available for car share services.

Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative.

## Bike

Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception.

## From Vancouver Island

The 480 bus to Bridgeport station will link up with buses that go to Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station.

<!--chapter:end:06-getting-to-ubc.Rmd-->

# UBC Portals {-#ubcportals}

## WorkDay {-#workday}

In November of 2020 UBC transitioned from the admin/HR MSP system to [Workday](https://hr.ubc.ca/working-ubc/welcome-workday) which is now used as the central hub for HR and administration processes. 

Be sure to partake in all of the Workday training opportunities that can be found [here](https://irp.ubc.ca/training) and [here](https://wpl.ubc.ca/browse/irp-training/), this system is effective but not entirely intuitive. Please contact IT services to report any issues or to request clarification on necessary Workday actions. 

Your main processes within Workday will include approving out of pocket [expense reports](#reimbursements).

## RISe {-#rise}

[Research Information Systems (RISe)](https://www.rise.ubc.ca/) is an online portal that allows researchers and administrators to manage and track applications online through to approval, certification and awarding of funds.

One of the main uses for RISe is ethics application and approval. Information on completing a UBC Behavioral Research Ethics Board application can be found [here](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/behavioural-research-ethics/breb-guidance-notes).

## One Drive {-#onedrive}

Since August 2020 all UBC faculty, staff, and students have access to OneDrive as a shared storage space. CDL lab members and admin generally utilize either DropBox or the shared Forestry Z drive for [digital storage and sharing](#shareddigital) although personal preference differs among members. Regardless of which storage option lab members utilize we all have access to OneDrive.


<!--chapter:end:10-ubc-portals.Rmd-->

# IT Services {-#itservices}

[IT services website](https://it.ubc.ca/) will provide you with countless pieces of vital information about how UBC’s IT system functions.

Norman Hodges ([norman.hodges@ubc.ca](mailto:norman.hodges@ubc.ca)) is the IT Technician for Forestry. When first arriving in the Department, some things that Norm may be able to help with are found below, however please do ensure that you first visit the IT services website and or [submit a service ticket](https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice) if necessary before contacting Norm directly. Please remember that you may contact the CDLab manager who will be willing and able to direct you to the best resources for the most efficient assistance. 

* Ordering computer hardware
* Installing software (eg. ArcGIS, R, Mendeley)
* Setting up a connection to the wifi and VPN
* Mapping the shared network drive

# Shared Digital Workspaces {-#shareddigital}

## Lab Workstation {-#workstation}

The lab workstation, or remote desktop, is a computer that is available for the lab to use when a task requires more power/RAM than is available with our laptops or personal computers. The computer itself sits in the lab room 3202, but can be connected to from anywhere you have access to the UBC VPN.

Please store any files that you need on the [shared drive](sharednetworkdrive) or the H drive rather than on the 3202a workstation/C drive as this system is reserved for running software that demands lots of memory and RAM. No one user should be taking up more than 10GB. Space usage is monitored.

Scheduling time is done through the workstation-booking channel on [Slack](#slack). You will be admitted to the CD Slack channel upon request by the lab manager. When using the remote workstation please be sure to monitor the slack channel as some lab members leave software running over night.

### Remote Desktop Connection {-#remoteconnect}

Connect to the UBC VPN guide on how to connect found here). The application ‘Remote Desktop Connection’ will connect you to the workstation. Access this by searching it in the Start Menu. Enter the link **frst-fcs-3202a.ead.ubc.ca** and your UBC credentials (ensure the domain is EAD\).

Once you have logged in for the first time you can create a shortcut to bypass the above steps. With the Remote Desktop Connection window open, click ‘show options’ and then save as to add the shortcut to your desktop or another location.

#### Useful settings

Settings are available in the Remote Desktop Connection window under ‘show options’. 

By default, when you connect to the workstation it will open up on only one of your screens (assuming you have multiple screens). To expand the workstation across your whole computer, tick ‘use all my monitors’ under the display tab. If the connection bar at the top of the screen gets in your way, you can hide it by unticking the box at the bottom of the display tab. To bring the connection bar back temporarily, use ctrl+alt+home. You can also move and shorten the connection bar.

To link your local drives and folders to the workstation, go to the local resources tab, then ‘more’, and tick ‘drives’. This will mean that all your folders from your regular computer will be available through the workstation (note that this step will not work on UBC-owned computers due to the way they are configured). To link the lab shared drive, map the drive as you did originally (see lab handbook for instructions).

If you are doing a task that requires a lot of power and is causing things to lag, you can reduce the colour depth under the display tab to improve performance.

#### Other things to know

Only one person can be logged onto the workstation and using applications at any one time. However, multiple people can also have things running in the background whilst being disconnected, and this can happen while someone else is logged in. For example, two lab members can have code running in R on the workstation while another lab member is logged in and using ArcGIS. Note that anything running in the background may slow down work that someone is doing whilst logged in, and vice versa.

To access the task manager (for example, if an application is not responding and you need to end the task), use ctrl+alt+end. Note that ctrl+alt+del will bring up the task manager for your local computer.

The default settings keep the clipboard activated, so you can copy and paste between the local computer and the workstation.

#### Logging out/disconnecting

DO NOT CLICK SHUT DOWN when using the workstation. Clicking shut down instead of disconnecting or logging out of the computer will turn the device off completely, meaning someone will have to go into the lab and physically turn it back on. This will not be damaging in any way, just an inconvenience, unless another user is running something in the background, then their work will be lost. 

Disconnecting from the workstation will take you back to your local computer, but the workstation will stay open in the background and whatever tasks you had running will continue. To disconnect, click the cross on the right of the connection bar at the top of the screen.

Logging off is the same as for your local computer, i.e. unsaved work will be lost. Log off by clicking on your name under the Start Menu. Please log off whenever you have finished using the workstation.

## Shared Network Drive {-#sharednetworkdrive}

The shared network drive for the lab is called T Martin lab network drive, and is stored on the UBC server. It is available to lab members that have a UBC email address and CWL, and can be accessed off-campus via the VPN. Access to this shared drive is managed by Norm Hodges who will require your CWL to ensure your access to the workspace. This drive is capped at 20GB.

The shared drive is used for storing files in a central, secure location. It is a useful way to back up files to the UBC server, and to allow large files to be shared with others in the lab instead of emailing them. You can encrypt files on the drive to maintain data security.

How to access this shared drive - Instructions on how to map the network drive can be found [here](https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/teamshare-storage-service/mapping-or-mounting-teamshare-macos). In step 2 of the instructions, login with the domain ‘ead’ and your CWL ID eg. ead\finnr. You may need to be on ubcsecure wifi network rather than eduroam to connect to the drive.  You can also connect from off campus if you’re on the UBC VPN.  

If you are having trouble connecting, contact the CDLab manager to ensure that you were given access. If this does not solve the issues contact Norm Hodges to help trouble shoot. 

## Dropbox {-#dropbox}

Shared dropbox folders are used within the CDL to share related files for certain projects. Upon your entry into the lab you will receive an invitation to the CDLab shared folder where you will find an assortment of helpful resources and information regarding the lab including equipment inventory, EDI statement and resources, ect. 

## Slack {-#slack}

Slack is a tool used for team communication. It is used for conversation that would otherwise clog our inboxes, such as quick project-related questions, lab events (eg. after work drinks), other events of interest (seminars, presentations etc.) weekly updates and general chit-chat. Documents and calendar invites can be shared in message threads called ‘channels’, with the option to also send private one-on-one messages.

Be aware that all lab members do not use Slack equally, so important communications should still be sent via email.

Your admittance to the CDLab Slack channel will be granted upon request by either the CDLab manager or another lab member. You will be required to create a Slack account. The app can also be downloaded for free.

## Github {-#github}

For those who have not yet been introduced to GitHub it is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.

The CDLab has a GitHub repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/ConservationDecisionsLab).

# Financial {-#financial}

## Out of Pocket Reimbursements {-#reimbursements}

The two common types of reimbursements are travel and non-travel expenses. Copies of the reimbursement request forms can be obtained from Forest and Conservation Sciences Reception (rm 3041), and are also available in digital form for print on the shared drive and in the shared dropbox folder found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Conservation%20Decisions%20Lab/07_Reimbursement%20forms).

To claim a reimbursement, you must have a copy of the original receipts and a speedchart (four-letter code) indicating which grant the claim will be charged to. You will need to send the completed forms and receipts to the CDLab manager who will review the information and will submit the reimbursement request to Christine Mutia. Each grant under Dr. Tara Martin’s name has a separate speed chart, please ensure that you have the correct speed chart information before submitting a request.

Please note that when charging kilometers driven please include a google map of the route that you took to prove the Kms stated on the expense form. 

## Small Scale Suppliers

When hiring or working with external contractors during projects please ensure that you contact the CDLab manager early and before the contractor begins work. The process of setting up an external supplier or vendor can take up to 6 weeks. Please speak to the CDLab manager for more information.

<!--chapter:end:13-financial.Rmd-->

# Lab Equipment [-#labequipment]

## General Field Equipment {-#fieldequipment}

The CDLab field equipment inventory can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Conservation%20Decisions%20Lab/01_Equipment?preview=Equipment+inventory.xlsx). This list is a work in progress and will be kept up to date as more items are purchased. If you require the use of any equipment please ensure that you alert the CDLab manager prior to your field work excursions to ensure that the equipment is up to date on repairs and servicing and is accessible to you (is the equipment on Salt Spring or in Vancouver).

Dr. Tara Martin, depending on the equipment in question and its function is willing to discuss the purchase of more equipment that could contribute to the overall function of the lab as a whole.

Please note that all lab equipment will be inspected before an after use and please use this equipment with care and as if it was your own. Thank you.

## Laptop Computers {-#laptops}

The CDLab has a number of laptops currently in circulation (see equipment inventory list), along with desktop monitors, wireless keyboards, mice, and HDMI cords. At the beginning of your appointment please alert the CDLab manager of your computer needs if not prompted.

Funding can be made available to purchase additional hardware space, RAM, and higher functioning devices if need be. A list of the devices that are most commonly ordered through UBC can be found [here](https://it.ubc.ca/services/desktop-print-services/desktop-and-laptop-setup-and-support/desktop-laptop-and-hardware). 

When a device is being readied to go to a new student you will be asked to provide a list of software that you would like installed. Norm Hodges will pre-load all of the software that he is able to install before you receive this device. 

While you are in possession of a CDLab/UBC owned and operated laptop you are expected to ensure proper care of the device by observing the following best practices. In general, if you’re prompted to update software, don’t ignore the prompts indefinitely.

* On the weekend after the second Tuesday of the month (otherwise known as Microsoft Patch Tuesday), do the following:
  * Start > Settings > Update & Security > Check for updates, allow the laptop to update and restart. 
* If a laptop user doesn’t routinely connect to the UBC VPN, they should connect for an hour or so every couple weeks to ensure Windows and Office licenses are updated and to ensure malware protection is updated.
* Otherwise, just remember the laptop is a fairly expensive piece of equipment. It’s not a hammer or a crowbar

## Lab Truck {-#labtruck}

The field truck is available for use by lab members for fieldwork. It is a 2017 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with lockable canopy. The designated parking stall in the parking lot below Forestry is #19, but the truck is often stored at Dr. Tara Martin’s lab space on Salt Spring Island and so arrangements to bring it to the mainland for work must be made in advance.

There is a UBC fuel card that should be used to fill up the vehicle, and is kept in a plastic sleeve in the glovebox. The purchase will then be charged to the designated project fund upon reconciliation. 

When using the vehicle, please remember the following:
* Fill with fuel at end of use (a use may be multiple days)
* Use fuel card in glovebox to fill up and keep receipts

Fill out logbook in glovebox at end of use.

## Research Vessel 

The lab’s research vessel is a 6.26m outboard Silverstream with a 150 horsepower (HP) Yamaha engine and a 9.9 HP kicker engine dubbed ‘Sea Blush’. The vessel is moored on Salt Spring Island at a private marina in the Fulford Harbor. The vessel will only be operated by qualified operators, Dr. Tara Martin or CDLab manager Abbie Sherwood. 

When budgeting the use of the research vessel for a project use the ratio of 1 nautical mile to 1$ of gas and maintenance. Marine engines should only be filled with mid-grade gasoline. Please take this information into consideration when budgeting for vessel use during project planning. 

## Projectors

The CDLab owns two projectors: a portable one and a ceiling-mounted system in the lab room. The portable projector can be used for meetings and gatherings as needed. The ceiling-mounted projector includes an electronic screen, and both are controlled from the panel to the right of the whiteboard. Contact [UBC AV services](https://it.ubc.ca/got-question-about-it-products-and-support#avhelpdesk) for any issues with the lab projector set up.

## UBC Storage Locker

The storage lockers are located in the basement in room 0711. The CDLab shares storage space with Dr. Lori Daniels and Dr. Peter Arcese. In the Martin-Daniels locker there are boxes of supplies for hosting workshops. In the Arcese locker is field gear. Ask the CDLab manager for access to this space.

## Specimen Fridge and Freezer

There is a specimen fridge and freezer in the lab room that are available for storing biological samples. The fridge for storing food is under the bench in the kitchen area. Please keep food and samples separate.

<!--chapter:end:13-lab-equipment.Rmd-->

# UBC Software Licensing {-#softwarelicenses}

[Here](https://it.ubc.ca/services/desktop-support-services/software-licensing) is a link to the Software Licensing UBC IT page where you can find lists of the software licenses available to students.

## ArcGIS

If you are using a UBC owned and operated laptop ArcGIS can easily be installed prior to laptop delegation. We also encourage the installation of QGIS as a great open source alternative to ArcGIS. When using personally owned devices students are eligible for the student one-year license, renewable after previous license expires and just for a single device, at a cost of $30. 

## Zoom

[Here](https://it.ubc.ca/services/teaching-learning-tools/zoom-video-conferencing) are the instructions for establishing an UBC Zoom account. If you are unable to successfully achieve a unlimited UBC license through the website contact the CDLab manager who will be able to submit a service ticket requesting a full license which allows for unlimited Zoom use.

# Field Work - How to prepare {-#fieldworkprep}

Preparing for field work is a very exciting time. When your preparation begins be sure to visit the following field work safety pages.

*	[Field Work Safety | Safety & Risk Services (ubc.ca)](https://srs.ubc.ca/health-safety/safety-programs/field-work-safety/)
*	[Conducting Off-campus Fieldwork | UBC Research + Innovation](https://research.ubc.ca/covid-19/conducting-off-campus-fieldwork)
*	[Travel and Field Safety l UBC](https://travelfieldsafety.ubc.ca/about/)

A Field Work Safety Plan is required for all field work and must be submitted to your Department for approval before you head out into the field. This approval process can take a few weeks hence it is best to begin thinking about the preparation of this document well in advance. 

A safety plan template can be found here in the CDLab shared dropbox folder [Safety Plans](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Conservation%20Decisions%20Lab/11_Health%20and%20Safety/01_Safety%20plans). 

Before submitting your plan for approval be sure to glace at the ‘Field Work Safety Plan – Completion checklist’. You can find this checklist in the same dropbox folder as stated above. 

Once Dr. Tara Martin has signed off on your safety plan you are ready to submit your safety plan for approval. Alter the CDLab manager when your plan is ready and they will indicate to whom you must send your safety form. 

<!--chapter:end:15-fieldwork-prep.Rmd-->
