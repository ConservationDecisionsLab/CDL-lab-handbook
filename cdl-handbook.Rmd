# Welcome {#welcome .unnumbered}

Welcome to the [Conservation Decisions lab](https://www.taramartin.org/) (CDLab) where your supervisor, Dr. Tara Martin aspires to inspire innovation, excellence in critical thinking, excellent quantitative skills and the ability to think and work across disciplines as conservation practitioners.

This student handbook has been designed as a guide to assist your transition into the UBC community and the community of the Conservation Decisions Lab. Within its contents you will find tips, tricks, and essential information for you as a student and as a lab member. 

If you find any information missing from the following pages or have any recommendations that could improve this guide please contact the CDLab manager, Abbie Sherwood who strives to make this an exhaustive resource. 

Please read this document in its entirety early on within your appointment to ensure that as a new lab member you are aware of the resources at your disposal and what is expected of each and every lab member. Dr. Tara Martin has committed to creating an active community within her lab space where she encourages the development of good collaborators and lab citizens. Within this space we commit to being intelligent, curious, motivated, compassionate, and hard-working.

Thank you for joining us in our efforts to turn ecological data into decision making

# Lab Member Commitments

## Lab Meetings

All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every three weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually. When the lab meetings are hosted at UBC, it is expected that all lab members are to attend face-to-face in order ensure that all lab members have the opportunity to socialize with other members, however we understand that exceptions must be made due to circumstance. 

When meetings are scheduled while under a public health order or regulation these meetings will be held virtually via Zoom.

Lab meetings present an opportunity for lab members to showcase their current work or work that they have done in the past and practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defense. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. Each lab member is expected to lead a lab meeting twice a year. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WAL131F2qjLT-kYOPUGV7lpESvUIczRtx1Q2oqTfdRQ/edit#gid=740242269) along with historical lab meeting topics. 

The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab member by the CDLab manager who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting.

As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our EDI statement these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for EDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone elseâ€™s but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so.

## 1-on-1 Meetings

Mentees will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. The CDLab manager will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to the CDLab manager.
