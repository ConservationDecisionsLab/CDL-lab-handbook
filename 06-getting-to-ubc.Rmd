# Getting to UBC {-#transportation}

## Bus

Buses that run between downtown and UBC include the 44, 4 and 14. The 99 B-line service also terminates at UBC. Many buses will take you to nearby Skytrain stations, such as VCC-Clark and Bridgeport. 

The information about U-Pass BC/Compass card which provides UBC students with universal, accessible and affordable access to public transit across the Metro Vancouver Region can be found [here](https://planning.ubc.ca/transportation/transit/u-pass-compass-card). UBC students pay for this pass via the mandatory student fees collected by UBC. 

A Compass card is the most cost-effective way of using Skytrains and buses, although cash and credit card are also accepted at tap-on points. Compass cards can be purchased at vending machines in Skytrain stations, UBC Bookstore, ferry terminals, and some London Drugs, Save on Foods and 7eleven outlets. For UBC students, the U-Pass can be added to your Compass card to give unlimited access to Skytrain, Canada Line and SeaBus services. 

A useful public transport app is ‘Transit’, which can be downloaded for free. Transport options include Skytrain, buses, bike share (Shaw bikes in the downtown area, or Hopr bikes on campus), and car share (Evo, Modo).

## Car

Car parking is available next to Forestry on Agronomy Road ($20/day). Parking permits can be purchased [here](https://parking.ubc.ca/permits-rates). Designated parking stalls are available for car share services.

Uber or Lyft are ride sharing apps that can be used as an alternative.

## Bike

Public bike racks are available outside of the FSC building. Unfortunately bicycle theft is a problem in Vancouver and at UBC so please keep your bike safe with a lock. The FSC complex also has secured bike racks in room 0711 in the basement. Space is limited, inquire at FCS Reception.

## From Vancouver Island

The 480 bus to Bridgeport station will link up with buses that go to Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. Buses 44, 4 and 14 stop at Waterfront Station, linking up with buses that go to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal. The seaplane terminal is also a short walk from Waterfront Station.
