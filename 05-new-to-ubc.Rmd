# New to UBC {#newtoubc .unnumbered}

We recommend that all graduate students keep the [GRADBOOK](https://forestry.ubc.ca/files/2023/04/Forestry-Gradbook.pdf) close at hand. This document outlines the policies and procedures for Forestry graduate students.

Here is a link to the [graduate student portal](https://forestry.ubc.ca/students/graduate-student-portal/) where you will find links to [graduate studies advising](https://forestry.ubc.ca/students/graduate-student-portal/graduate-student-advising/) and links to [financial support opportunities](https://forestry.ubc.ca/students/graduate-student-portal/financial-support/) among many other resources.

## Building Access

Access to individual offices requires a key, which will be requested by FCS reception and issued by the Access Desk at the Bookstore, with a $20 security deposit (this information is from the 2020 academic year). Most students will not be provided with an office but will use the lab space as work stations. 

Since 2020, the FCS building has undergone a change of key system. As September 2021 approaches all lab members will receive an updated email from the FCS reception desk and the CDLab manager regarding new access processes which will utilize student/employee key cards. 

For card configuration issues see [Andrea Chan](#contacts). 

For after hours access issues call Campus Security 604 822 2222.

Room 3101 has wall space for a projector, which can be borrowed from FCS Reception (try to book in advance). These rooms must be booked in advance through [Natasha Thompson](#contacts) at the FCS reception, and a key obtained from her at time of use.

## Hazardous Waste 

Information about hazardous waste disposal at UBC can be found [here](https://srs.ubc.ca/environment/hazardous-waste-management/hazardous-waste-manual/).

Some items/substances that may be used in the lab and are subject to safe disposal protocols are:
* Sharps (syringes, razors, blades)
* Animal blood
* Uncontaminated animal carcasses
* Non-indigenous species (includes soil and plants)

Disposal of biological waste may require special training. Contact Rolando Descalzo, Collections Manager, for waste disposal inquires ([rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca](mailto:rolando.descalzo@ubc.ca)).

Sharps disposal containers can be purchased from the Chemistry Store on the corner of Main Mall and University Boulevard using a journal voucher.
