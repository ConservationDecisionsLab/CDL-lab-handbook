## Lab Meetings {-#labmeetings}

All lab members are expected to attend our lab meetings which take place every three weeks. Meetings are held in our lab room and off campus students are able to join virtually via Zoom. Currently, Tara teaches each week during the fall semester and is able to attend lab meetings in person, however may not be able to do so as regularly during the spring semester. It is strongly encouraged that all lab members attend in-person whenever possible as lab meetings offer a valuable opportunity to engage with other lab members and helps to foster a sense of community within the lab. However, we understand that circumstances differ amongst lab members and this may not always be possible. 

Lab meetings present a valuable opportunity for lab members to practice for upcoming presentations or thesis defenses and receive feedback from lab members. Additionally, students might use lab meetings to showcase their current work, or work that they have done in the past. These meetings also serve as a platform that provides space for members to bring any topic to the table for discussion. CDL has also hosted joint lab meetings to build relationships with other labs. 

Lab members are expected to take turns leading lab meetings. The sign-up sheet for the lab meeting facilitators can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WAL131F2qjLT-kYOPUGV7lpESvUIczRtx1Q2oqTfdRQ/edit?gid=1290560221#gid=1290560221). This file also includes ideas for future meeting topics as well as a record of past lab meeting topics. 

The lab meetings will be scheduled with every new semester and will be timed according to the collective availability of the lab community. Once determined, the lab meeting schedule will be sent out to all lab members by Madeline who will also send out meeting reminders and any related material that are to be reviewed prior to the lab meeting.

As part of the commitment that our lab community has made in our JEDI statement, these lab meetings will commonly be used as a time and platform for JEDI related conversations. This is a safe and confidential space where lab members are welcome to ask hard questions, be met with compassionate and difficult answers and to explore new and deeper components of our own experience through conversation within community. Please remember that during these difficult and vital conversations you are not expected to adhere your boundaries to anyone elseâ€™s, but that if you are comfortable to expand your comfort zone this is an excellent and safe space with which to do so. Furthermore, we will review our JEDI statement and commitments as a lab on an annual basis to ensure that this statement adapts as we gain new lab members and as our collective knowledges & understandings continue to develop.

## 1-on-1 Meetings {-#1on1}

Lab members will meet with Dr. Tara Martin for a 1-on-1 meeting every three weeks. The default length of these meetings are 30 minutes although an extended meeting is available upon request. Madeline will schedule these meetings at the beginning of each semester, according to each person's availability, and will send out event invites and zoom links when meetings will be held virtually and in person. Please direct any scheduling questions to Madeline (<madelinewoodley22@gmail.com>). 

## Staff Meetings {-#staffmeetings}

CDL staff meet for one hour every three weeks (on lab meeting & 1-on-1 weeks). These meetings offer staff an opportunity to check-in and discuss topics related to lab operations and staff-led projects. Madeline will schedule these meetings at the start of each semester according to the availability of the staffing team.

## Lab Retreat {-#labretreat}

CDL aims to host an annual lab retreat over the summer, based on group availability. In 2024 and 2025 lab retreats have been hosted on Salt Spring Island (see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AMvKOws4EWVQJZyNmnzQj1cpdBKON0Xs) for past years' itineraries), however input regarding alternative locations is always welcome. All lab members are encouraged to make lab retreat attendance a priority, as this is a valuable opportunity for relationship-building and informal conversations around mental health, degree & career planning, and more.
